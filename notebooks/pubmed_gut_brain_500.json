        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The brain imaging subtypes of schizophrenia have been widely investigated using data-driven approaches. However, the heterogeneity of SZ in multiple biological data is largely unknown.\nMETHODS: A data-driven model was used to classify brain imaging, gut microbiota, and brain-gut fusion data obtained through a dot product fusion method, identifying significant subtypes and calculating their correlations with clinical symptoms and cognitive performance.\nRESULTS: These subtypes remain relatively independent and demonstrate typical features and biomarkers, which are significantly associated with clinical symptoms and cognitive performance. Two brain subtypes with opposite structural and functional changes are identified: (1) a structural variant-dominant brain subtype with negative symptoms and cognitive deficits and (2) a functional alteration-dominant brain subtype with positive symptoms. The three gut subtypes include the following: (1) Collinsella-dominant; (2) Prevotella-dominant with positive symptoms; and (3) Streptococcus-dominant. Two brain-gut subtypes show different abnormalities in brain‒genus linkages: (1) strong connectivity of \"brain function in the temporal and parietal lobes-Prevotella\" with reduced attention scores and (2) strong connectivity of \"brain structure and function in the frontal and parietal lobes-multiple genera\" with positive symptoms. Notably, brain subtypes and brain-gut subtypes are most relevant to clinical symptoms, whereas gut subtypes reveal more cognitive biomarkers.\nCONCLUSION: These findings show the potential to identify multiple biological subtypes with distinct biomarkers, thereby suggesting the possibility of personalized and precise treatment for SZ patients."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is reduced in the brain of various central nervous system (CNS) disorders, but its relation to peripheral expression remains unclear. This study aimed to determine peripheral BDNF expression affected by BDNF promoter IV defect and enriched environment treatment (EET). Promoter IV defect is associated with CNS disorders and chronic stress, whereas EET increases hippocampal BDNF expression and ameliorates CNS dysfunctions.\nMETHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measured BDNF protein levels in eleven regions (hippocampus, frontal cortex, heart, lung, liver, spleen, intestine, kidney, intestine, thymus, muscle, serum) in wild-type and knock-in promoter IV (KIV) mice with or without 3 weeks of EET provided after weaning.\nRESULTS: Knock-in promoter IV resulted in BDNF levels significantly decreased in muscle, but significantly increased in intestine, liver, thymus, and serum, which suggests compensatory upregulation of other promoters in those tissues. EET increased BDNF levels in muscle and serum of KIV mice and thymus of wild-type mice, suggesting EET's beneficial effects in muscle motor and adaptive immune regulation. EET increased hippocampal BDNF levels in both genotypes, which significantly negatively correlated with intestine BDNF levels, suggesting its role in the brain-gut axis. EET reduced wild-type heart BDNF levels, possibly through parasympathetic regulation. Significant positive BDNF correlations were observed among serum-muscle, serum-thymus, lung-spleen, and intestine-liver, suggesting inter-organ interaction and regulation of BDNF. Partial Least Squares discriminant analyses (PLS-DA) identified that variations in BDNF levels in intestine, liver, frontal cortex, and serum contribute most to classify promoter IV defect, and those in hippocampus, serum, heart, thymus, and liver contribute most to classify EET effects.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate how genetic and environmental factors affect BDNF expression in peripheral tissues, highlighting the complex BDNF correlations across organ systems and suggesting usefulness of multivariate BDNF analyses for detecting promoter IV defect and enriched environment effects. Elucidation of BDNF's role and regulatory mechanisms in peripheral organ systems may help better our understanding of its connection to CNS disorders and their treatments."

Probiotics are live, non-pathogenic microorganisms that benefit the host by regulating the gut microbiome. This review aims to study the effect of probiotics and ketogenic diets on gut microbiota and their potential as a therapy for epilepsy. We conducted a systematic search of the databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and the Web of Science for pertinent studies that have been published. Our search methodology was meticulously structured to be exhaustive, integrating targeted keywords and Boolean operators to guarantee the acquisition of all potentially pertinent articles. Probiotics interact with the gut microbiome, balance its composition, and influence the gut-brain axis. Moreover, they reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The ketogenic diet (KD) affects gut bacteria, influencing neurotransmitter levels and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which play a role in the gut-brain axis. Studies have shown the positive effects of various probiotics in animal models of epilepsy. They demonstrate improvements in seizure activity, anxiety, and neuroinflammation. In human studies, probiotics reduced seizure frequency and enhanced quality of life in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We believe using probiotics or dietary interventions like KD could be a promising therapeutic strategy for managing epilepsy. This could reduce seizure frequency and make life better for patients with epilepsy."

        "abstract": "While transplanting the fecal microbiota from young to aged rodents has been extensively studied (that is, young FMT [yFMT]), its mechanism of alleviating working memory decline has not been fully elucidated. In this report, we aimed to investigate the effect of yFMT on the working memory of aged recipient rats performing delayed match-to-position (DMTP) tasks and the associated cellular and molecular mechanisms. The results revealed that yFMT mitigated the decline in DMTP task performance of aged recipients. This improvement was associated with a reshaped gut microbiota and increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1, and synaptophysin, enhancing synaptic formation and transmission. The remodeling of the gut microbiome influenced peripheral circulation and the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex by regulating the Th17/Treg ratio and microglial polarization. Ultimately, interleukin-4 and interleukin-17 emerged as potential key molecules driving the beneficial effects of FMT. These observations provide new insights into the gutbrain axis, emphasizing the connection between the gut and brain through the circulation system, and suggest an immunological mechanism that may help reverse age-related declines in the gut microbiota."

This paper surveys literature pertinent to the Mediterranean diet with respect to schizophrenia, bipolar and unipolar depression and cognition. The National Library of Medicine database of literature was searched for publications relating to our topic through June 2024. Our results highlight the Mediterranean diet's potential role in mediating inflammation, potentially through the gut-brain axis, and its neuroprotective role against cognitive decline. Moreover, individual components of the Mediterranean diet are potentially therapeutic as well as protective, particularly fruits, vegetables, fatty fish, and whole grains. These dietary components reduce systemic inflammation, modulate gut microbiota and influence critical pathways such as moderating oxidative stress. Overall, this survey of recent literature highlights the potential of the Mediterranean diet to promote mental health and reduce the risk or severity of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The analysis underscores broader implications for the Mediterranean diet in advancing mental health outcomes and emphasizes the need for further studies and increased public education to encourage healthier eating habits and dietary interventions."

        "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is closely associated with the pathological manifestations of multiple neurodegenerative diseases via the gut-brain axis, which refers to the crosstalk between the gut and the central nervous system. More importantly, mitochondria have been considered prominent mediators of the interplay between the gut microbiota and the brain. Intestinal microbes may modulate mitochondrial function in the central nervous system to affect the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria are essential for meeting the host's substantial neuronal metabolic demands, maintaining excitability, and facilitating synaptic transmission. Dysfunctional mitochondria are considered critical hallmarks of various neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this review provides novel insights into the intricate roles of gut microbiota-mitochondrial crosstalk in the underlying mechanisms during the progression of neurodegeneration, as well as the existing potential therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders. These suggest intestinal microbiota-mitochondrial interaction play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases, and targeting this interaction may be a promising therapeutic approach to neurodegenerative diseases. However, this review found that there was relatively little research on the effect of this crosstalk on other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease and Multiple sclerosis, and the potential therapeutic strategies were translated into clinical trials, which face many challenges in developing personalized treatment plans based on the unique gut microbiota of different individuals."

Delayed diagnosis, physical discomfort, hormone therapy, and inconvenience in daily life and work all contribute to a decreased quality of life for endometriosis patients. Early clinical diagnosis is highly important for the intervention and treatment of endometriosis. Currently, reliable non-invasive diagnostic methods are lacking, and laparoscopic examination combined with pathological diagnosis is considered the \"gold standard\" for definitively diagnosing endometriosis. An increasing number of studies have confirmed the correlation between endometriosis and microbial ecological changes. Microbial dysbiosis is an important factor in the development and progression of endometriosis. Certain key microbial species and their metabolites can induce functional alterations in endometrial cells through various mechanisms, often preceding the emergence of clinical symptoms. Endometriosis are chronic inflammatory diseases, with an immunoinflammatory response as the pathological foundation. The microbiome may participate in the pathological mechanisms of endometriosis through multiple pathways, including mediating inflammatory responses, regulating immune responses, participating in estrogen regulation, interfering with metabolic activities, and modulating the gut-brain axis. Therefore, the microbiome holds potential as an early non-invasive diagnostic and therapeutic target for endometriosis patients. This study summarizes and analyses the correlations between microorganisms and their metabolites and the onset of endometriosis, aiming to provide novel insights into the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of endometriosis."

        "abstract": "As a significant mental health disorder worldwide, the treatment of depression has long faced the challenges of a low treatment rate, significant drug side effects and a high relapse rate. Recent studies have revealed that the gut microbiota and neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction play central roles in the pathogenesis of depression: the gut microbiota influences the course of depression through multiple pathways, including immune regulation, HPA axis modulation and neurotransmitter metabolism. Mitochondrial function serves as a key hub that mediates mood disorders through mechanisms such as defective energy metabolism, impaired neuroplasticity and amplified neuroinflammation. Notably, a bidirectional regulatory network exists between the gut microbiota and mitochondria: the flora metabolite butyrate enhances mitochondrial biosynthesis through activation of the AMPK-PGC1α pathway, whereas reactive oxygen species produced by mitochondria counteract the flora composition by altering the intestinal epithelial microenvironment. In this study, we systematically revealed the potential pathways by which the gut microbiota improves neuronal mitochondrial function by regulating neurotransmitter synthesis, mitochondrial autophagy, and oxidative stress homeostasis and proposed the integration of probiotic supplementation, dietary fiber intervention, and fecal microbial transplantation to remodel the flora-mitochondrial axis, which provides a theoretical basis for the development of novel antidepressant therapies targeting gut-brain interactions."

        "abstract": "Short-chain fatty acids, metabolites produced by the fermentation of dietary fiber by gut microbiota, have garnered significant attention due to their correlation with neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease. In this review, we summarize the changes in short-chain fatty acid levels and the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria in various samples from patients with Parkinson's disease, highlighting the critical role of gut homeostasis imbalance in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Focusing on the nervous system, we discuss the molecular mechanisms by which short-chain fatty acids influence the homeostasis of both the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system. We identify key processes, including the activation of G protein-coupled receptors and the inhibition of histone deacetylases by short-chain fatty acids. Importantly, structural or functional disruptions in the enteric nervous system mediated by these fatty acids may lead to abnormal α-synuclein expression and gastrointestinal dysmotility, which could serve as an initiating event in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we propose that short-chain fatty acids help establish communication between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system via the vagal nerve, immune circulation, and endocrine signaling. This communication may shed light on their potential role in the transmission of α-synuclein from the gut to the brain. Finally, we elucidate novel treatment strategies for Parkinson's disease that target short-chain fatty acids and examine the challenges associated with translating short-chain fatty acid-based therapies into clinical practice. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the pivotal role of short-chain fatty acids in regulating gut-brain axis integrity and their significance in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease from the perspective of the nervous system. Moreover, it highlights the potential value of short-chain fatty acids in early intervention for Parkinson's disease. Future research into the molecular mechanisms of short-chain fatty acids and their synergistic interactions with other gut metabolites is likely to advance the clinical translation of innovative short-chain fatty acid-based therapies for Parkinson's disease."

Case-control studies on the characteristics of gut microbiota in depression and anxiety were included. Methodological quality assessment of included studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). A qualitative synthesis was conducted to assess bacterial diversity (α- and β-diversity) and taxa abundance differences at the phylum, family, and genus levels.\nRESULTS: A total of 24 articles were included in the systematic review, 20 studies were conducted in China. Our results showed that the findings of the α- and β-diversity assessments were inconsistent for both depression and anxiety. In gut microbiota composition, we found that depression and anxiety were characterized by an enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria and a depletion of anti-inflammatory SCFAs-producing bacteria. Specifically, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Rikenellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae were more abundant in the depression group, as well as Firmicutes, Prevotellacea and Ruminococcaceae in lower abundance. In the anxiety group, the abundance of Firmicutes, Lachnospira, Faecalibacterium, Sutterella, and Butyricicoccus was lower, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes, Enterobacteriaceae, and Fusobacterium was increased.\nCONCLUSIONS: The systematic review found that depression and anxiety might be characterized by an enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria and the depletion of anti-inflammatory SCFAs-producing bacteria. However, there were conflicting reports on the abundance of bacteria due to confounders such as diet and psychotropic medications. Further studies are strongly suggested.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."

Recently, growing evidence has suggested that a specific gut microbiome is associated with the pathophysiology of PD through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. We previously discovered that Proteus mirabilis induced motor impairment and brain dopaminergic neurodegeneration in normal mice. In this context, exploring beneficial microbe would be reasonable strategy to treat PD fundamentally. With that the current study aimed to evaluate whether Lactobacillus taiwanensis BCRC17755 (BCRC17755) could ameliorate PD pathologies induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and P. mirabilis in mice. To demonstrate this, we measured motor function by performing pole test and the rotarod test and conducted histological analysis to assess the changes of factors in both brain and the gut. As a result, BCRC17755 decreased faecal abundance of P. mirabilis, which was higher in both the MPTP and P. mirabilis-treated mice. Additionally, BCRC17755 improved the motor deficits and alleviated damage to nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons observed in both MPTP and P. mirabilis-induced PD mice. Furthermore, BCRC17755 mitigated microglial hyperactivation triggered by MPTP and P. mirabilis in the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum of mice. Similarly, the release of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha, was suppressed following the administration of BCRC17755 in the colon.

Several bacterial strains can produce GABA, yet their real-world impacts are poorly understood. We investigated the impact of 2 doses of the strain Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Lp815 on anxiety, sleep, mood, quality of life, cognition, heart rate variability and adverse events in adults with mild to moderate anxiety over a 6-week period. The trial was structured as a double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial with optional open label extension. Participants were blindly assigned to receive either a placebo, 1 billion colony-forming units (CFU), or 5 billion CFU of the oral capsule per day. Participants completed biweekly anxiety, insomnia and cognition measures, daily mood, sleep, and quality of life surveys, and collected wearable heart rate variability. 83 individuals were evaluated, aged 39 ± 13 years, 63% female and 64% Caucasian. Participants receiving 5 billion CFU exhibited significantly lower anxiety (GAD-7) scores at weeks 4 and 6 compared to placebo (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.05). This result was clinically meaningful, with 68% of participants in the 5 billion CFU cohort exhibiting improvement by more than one category in their GAD-7 scores at week 6, compared to 37% in the 1 billion CFU group and 26% in the placebo group (e.g. from moderate to no anxiety) (Fisher's exact test P = 0.002 for 5 billion CFU vs Placebo).

Using the water-avoidance stress model in the APP/PS1 preclinical mouse model of AD, we investigate how chronic stress exacerbates neurobehavioral dysfunction and cognitive impairment and explore the neuroprotective potential of indole-3-propionate (IPA), a microbiome-derived metabolite, in mitigating these effects. Our findings show that psychological stress leads to depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, as indicated by reduced grooming and exploration behaviors; however, these effects are ameliorated by IPA supplementation. Stress also disrupts the gut microbiome and promotes intestinal inflammation. While IPA does not significantly alter microbiome composition, it mitigates inflammation by normalizing IL-17a and TGF-β gene expression and reducing TNF-⍺ and IL-6 protein levels. Although stress has a limited effect on hippocampal inflammation, IPA suppresses low-grade neuroinflammation by downregulating IL-1β, TNF-⍺, IL-6, and MCP-1 protein levels. Additionally, IPA treatment tends to reduce hippocampal amyloid-β plaques. These findings highlight the detrimental effects of chronic psychosocial stress on AD pathology and suggest that IPA may confer neuroprotection through the gut-immune-brain axis, supporting the therapeutic potential of microbial metabolites in mitigating cognitive decline."

Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-10 levels in tissues were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Additionally, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) activation was confirmed using western blotting.\nRESULTS: NRF2 was predicted to be the key transcription factor underlying the therapeutic effects of rhapontin in PD, and its anti-PD action may be associated with its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Rhapontin ameliorated the loss of dopaminergic neurons and gastrointestinal dysfunction in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mice by activating NRF2. Additionally, rhapontin treatment significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β) in the substantia nigra, striatum, and colon, whereas it increased anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) levels only in the colon, indicating the involvement of gut-brain axis in its neuroprotective potential. Finally, NRF2 was identified as a key transcription factor activated by rhapontin, particularly in the colon.\nCONCLUSION: We elucidated the effects of rhapontin in MPTP-induced PD mouse models using a combination of network pharmacology analysis, behavioral assessments, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and Western blotting. Our findings revealed the multifaceted role of rhapontin in ameliorating PD through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, particularly by activating NRF2, paving the way for future research into targeted therapies for PD."

Untargeted plasma metabolomics offers a valuable approach to uncover underlying pathomechanisms and identify actionable biomarkers. In this study, plasma samples from 18 pediatric patients with epilepsy and 11 age-matched healthy controls were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical methods and pathway enrichment analysis. Multivariate analyses demonstrated separation between the patient and control groups. A total of 19 endogenous metabolites (VIP > 1, adjusted p < 0.05) emerged as key differentiators. Compared with controls, patients exhibited significant reductions in tryptophan (Trp), 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), several gut microbiota-derived metabolites, including indole, indoxyl sulfate, and p-cresyl sulfate, as well as in niacin metabolism end-products - N1-Methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (Met2PY) and N1-Methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (Met4PY). In addition, patients showed decreased levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, concomitant with an increase in fatty acid derivatives and N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). The most substantially altered metabolic pathways in epilepsy patients involved the TCA cycle, vitamin A and C metabolism, prostaglandin synthesis, and D4/E4-neuroprostane formation. Observed alterations in tryptophan and microbiota-derived metabolites suggest gut dysbiosis may contribute to epilepsy development through the gut-brain axis. Moreover, the circulatory metabolic markers indicating an energy deficit and oxidative stress underscore the systemic impact of seizure activity."

Research has consistently shown bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain through neuronal, endocrine, and immunological, and chemical pathways. Recent neuroscience studies have linked changes in the microbiome and microbial metabolites to various neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and neurocognitive disorders. Novel metagenome-wide association studies have confirmed these microbiome variations in large samples and expanded our understanding of the interactions between human genes and the gut microbiome. The causal relationship between gut microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders is being elucidated through the establishment of large cohort studies incorporating microbiome data and advanced statistical techniques. Ongoing animal and human studies focused on the microbiota-gut-brain axis are promising for developing new prevention and treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric conditions. The scope of these studies has broadened from microbiome-modulating therapies including prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and postbiotics to more extensive approaches such as fecal microbiota transplantation. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have strengthened the evidence base for these innovative treatments. Despite extensive research over the past decade, many intriguing aspects still need to be elucidated regarding the role and therapeutic interventions of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in neuropsychiatric disorders."

        "abstract": "The human gut flora of trillions of bacteria is vital for general health and greatly influences digestion, immune system function, and brain development. Through neuronal, hormonal, and immunological channels, the gut-brain axis (GBA), a bidirectional communication network, links the gut microbiota to the central nervous system (CNS). This relationship has been linked to affective diseases, including depression and anxiety, as well as mental health issues. This review explores the intricate relationship between gut bacteria and mood disorders, focusing on how gut microbiota-host interactions, immune system modulation, and neurotransmitter control support mental health. The function of important microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in preserving blood-brain barrier integrity and modulating neuroinflammation is covered in this review. It also examines the bidirectional impact between gut health and mental health, including how dysbiosis could aggravate mood disorders and how depressed states might change the composition of gut bacteria. Furthermore, we discuss how psychotropic drugs affect gut flora and consider other elements such as nutrition and lifestyle that affect gut microbiome composition. Potential paths for treating mood disorders through gut microbiota modification are presented as emerging treatment techniques, including probiotics, nutritional therapies, and precision medicine. The development of new therapeutic approaches for mood disorders depends on the awareness of the GBA. Gut bacteria significantly affect mental health through immune modulation, neurotransmitter generation, and other intricate processes. Future studies should concentrate on large, varied populations to better understand these interactions and to create customized treatments that combine gut microbiota modulation with conventional mental health therapies."

The prescription of antibiotics, antidepressants, adverse negative DNA methylation reactions and a dysbiotic gut microbiome have been cited as causal for the development and progression of depression. While research continues to investigate the microbiome-gut-brain axis, this review will explore the state of persistence of gut bacteria that underpins bacterial dormancy, possibly due to adverse environmental conditions and/or pharmaceutical prescriptions. Bacterial dormancy persistence in the intestinal microbial cohort could affect the role of bacterial epigenomes and DNA methylations. DNA methylations are highly motif driven exerting significant control on bacterial phenotypes that can disrupt bacterial metabolism and neurotransmitter formation in the gut, outcomes that can support adverse mood dispositions."

We aimed to investigate the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) treatment on PND via mediating Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/Phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Using 16S rDNA sequencing targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable regions, we first demonstrated significant gut microbiota dysbiosis in PND model rats, accompanied by altered SCFAs profiles. Subsequent fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments established causal relationships between PND-associated microbial alterations and spatial cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, SCFAs supplementation attenuated neuronal damage and restored synaptic plasticity, as evidenced by Nissl staining quantification (reduced chromatolysis), TUNEL assay (decreased apoptosis rate), and immunohistochemical analysis (upregulated NeuN expression). Molecular investigations revealed that SCFAs-mediated cognitive improvement involved BDNF upregulation and subsequent PI3K/Akt pathway activation, ultimately enhancing neuronal survival and synaptic integrity. Notably, PND animals exhibited characteristic neuropathological features including synaptic density reduction (PSD-95 downregulation), neuroinflammation amplification (IL-6 elevation), and apoptosis activation-all significantly reversed by SCFA intervention. Our findings establish a novel gut-brain axis mechanism wherein microbiota-derived SCFAs may exert neuroprotection through BDNF-dependent PI3K/Akt signaling, and offer potential therapeutic strategies for PND management."

Its etiology involves bacterial colonization, enteral formula feeding, and hypoxic-ischemic injury. The pathology of necrotizing enterocolitis is characterized by coagulation necrosis and bacterial overgrowth, with limited preventative methods available. In addition to affecting the intestine, this disease has long-term neurological consequences for survivors. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, a well-established treatment for soft tissue infections and injuries caused by hypoperfusion, may serve as an alternative approach for necrotizing enterocolitis. In this study, a necrotizing enterocolitis model was developed in newborn Sprague-Dawley rat pups through the administration of a hyperosmolar formula, combined with exposure to hypothermia and hypoxia. The rat pups received hyperbaric oxygen therapy sessions at 3 absolute atmospheres for 2 hours each, which were administered over 1 or 2 days. The results demonstrated that hyperbaric oxygen therapy significantly reduced mortality in rats with necrotizing enterocolitis and preserved the number of brain cells in the hippocampus. Additionally, hyperbaric oxygen therapy increased the expression of nitric oxide synthase, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, and superoxide dismutase 3 in the intestine, and elevated superoxide dismutase 3 levels in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that hyperbaric oxygen therapy not only reduces mortality but also mitigates the severity of intestinal and brain lesions in experimental necrotizing enterocolitis, preserving intestinal cell integrity and enhancing antioxidant mechanisms."

Secondary outcomes included include risk of anal cancer, surgery, stoma and risk factors associated with anal stricture.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,007 patients were included (median age at diagnosis, 14.5 years; IQR, 12.0-16.1), median duration of follow-up 8.8 years (IQR, 4.6-14.2)). Among them one (0,1%) had an anal stricture at diagnosis and 26 (2.6%) during follow-up. From diagnosis, the 5- and 10-years cumulative incidence of anal stricture at was 0.6% (95% CI, 0.1-1.1) and 1.4% (95% CI, 0.5-2.3), respectively. Twenty-five (n = 25/27, 93%) patients had at least one episode of anal ulceration or fistulizing perineal Crohn's disease. In multivariable analysis, extraintestinal manifestations (HR 2.2, 95% CI, 1.0-4.8, p = 0.0270), colonic location (L2 vs L3 HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.6-2.7, p = 0.0064) and a history of fistulizing perineal Crohn's disease (HR 9.9, 95% CI, 4.3-22.8, p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with anal stricture. After a median follow-up of 6.2 years (2.4-10.6), 11 (41%) patients required at least one anal dilatation, and healing was observed in one patient. One patient (3.7%) had an anal cancer 7 years after stricture diagnosis, and 9 (33%) patients needed a stoma.

Here, C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to TPHP or DPHP for 12 weeks at estimated daily intake doses of 0.1 and 7 μg/kg bw/day. TPHP intake affected the levels of short-chain fatty acids and bile acids in the gut, enhancing the production of 29 medium- and long-chain fatty acids in the liver by 3.72-fold and significantly increasing hepatic lipid and cholesterol levels. Metabolomic and molecular analysis confirmed that elevated liver cholesterol levels persisted after an 8 week recovery period. Gut microbiota-dependent cholesterol alterations were the toxic end points observed in TPHP-fed mice, as supported by the results of fecal microbiota transplantation. In DPHP-fed mice, serotonergic and glutamatergic synapses were simultaneously altered in the liver and intestine, corresponding to the reduction of five brain neurotransmitters (15.4-60.8%). Decreased liver carbohydrate levels and insulin resistance were observed in the DPHP-fed mice. These results suggest that TPHP and DPHP affect metabolism via different toxic modes, mediated through the gut-liver axis, providing novel insights into the mechanisms of organophosphate-ester-mediated metabolic disruption."

This interplay occurs primarily through neuronal, immune, and metabolic pathways. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota has been associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In recent years, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has gained attention as an innovative therapeutic approach, aiming to restore microbial balance in the gut while influencing neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways. This review explores the mechanisms by which FMT impacts the gut-brain axis. Key areas of focus include its ability to reduce neuroinflammation, strengthen gut barrier integrity, regulate neurotransmitter production, and reinstate microbial diversity. Both preclinical and clinical studies indicate that FMT can alleviate motor and cognitive deficits in PD and AD, lower neuroinflammatory markers in MS, and enhance respiratory and neuromuscular functions in ALS. Despite these findings, several challenges remain, including donor selection complexities, uncertainties about long-term safety, and inconsistencies in clinical outcomes. Innovations such as synthetic microbial communities, engineered probiotics, and AI-driven analysis of the microbiome hold the potential to improve the precision and effectiveness of FMT in managing neurodegenerative conditions. Although FMT presents considerable promise as a therapeutic development, its widespread application for neurodegenerative diseases requires thorough validation through well-designed, large-scale clinical trials. It is essential to establish standardized protocols, refine donor selection processes, and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind its efficacy."

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and dysfunction such as constipation, gastroparesis, and dysphagia are common in PD, are difficult to manage, and negatively impact quality of life. Additionally, constipation often precedes motor symptoms by decades, perhaps suggesting that a disrupted bidirectional microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) is present early in PD. Data from mechanistic studies in rodent models and observational human studies demonstrate that gut-microbiota dysbiosis, intestinal hyperpermeability, and gut inflammation may promote neuroinflammation and α-synuclein aggregation, inciting loss of dopaminergic neurons. Studies also indicate that the intestinal milieu may influence symptom severity as well as response to PD treatments. These findings underscore the potential role of the gut as: (1) a site of early diagnosis and risk stratification for populations at high-risk for PD and (2) a potentially disease-modifying treatment approach. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of the gut-brain axis in PD pathogenesis, clinical disease course, prodromal GI symptoms and their underlying mechanisms, and stresses current knowledge gaps and future directions."

An imbalance of our immune cell subsets, both innate and adaptive, and the microbes in any of our microbiomes might lead to more cellular damage from excessive inflammation and oxidative stress and less immune regulation. The immune dysregulation may occur due to the loss of endometrial barriers enabling the spread of microbes, environmental pollutants, and allergens. Heat waves, sleep deprivation, and increased prevalence of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls, which weaken endothelial barriers, may be responsible for the enhanced prevalence of physical and psychological stresses.

Depression was defined as antidepressant use or high Beck Depression Inventory-II scores. Gut microbiota was characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing, and faecal metabolites were analysed via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Participants with depression exhibited significant differences in gut microbial composition and metabolic profiles. Differentially abundant taxa included Acidaminococcus, Christensenellaceae R-7 group, and Megasphaera, among others. Metabolomic analysis revealed 15 significantly altered metabolites, primarily lipids, organic acids, and benzenoids, some of which correlated with gut microbial features. This study highlights the interplay between the gut microbiota and depression, paving the way for future research to determine whether gut microbiota influences depression pathophysiology or reflects changes associated with depression."

Diel locomotor activity is an output of arthropod circadian activity and is influenced by factors such as light, temperature, and infection status. The biogenic amines histamine and serotonin (5-HT) are ingested with blood and differ between healthy hosts and those with severe malaria. They regulate malaria parasite infection in Anopheles stephensi, but the degree to which aging, temperature, and infection interact with ingested biogenic amines to influence mosquito behavior was unknown prior to these studies. We provisioned A. stephensi with histamine and 5-HT at healthy- and malaria-associated levels to examine diel locomotor activity of uninfected A. stephensi across lifespan, at temperatures that A. stephensi could encounter within its range, and on Plasmodium yoelii-infected mosquitoes during sporogony. We further evaluated treatment effects on retinal sensitivity of uninfected mosquitoes during light and dark periods typically associated with low and high activity for this crepuscular species. Treatment with malaria-associated levels of histamine and 5-HT significantly increased the locomotor activity of A. stephensi across lifespan and enhanced retinal sensitivity to a broad spectrum of wavelengths at the onset of light. This treatment in combination with higher temperatures also increased activity levels and broadened the peak hours of activity of A. stephensi. Notably, these effects were infection dependent. Together, our data suggest that histaminergic and serotonergic signaling within the gut-brain axis of A. stephensi could be targeted to alter mosquito activity and visual sensitivity as the basis for novel transmission-blocking strategies for malaria control."

It can lead to multifaceted pathological alterations including neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis, blood-brain barrier disruption, synaptic plasticity deficits, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), ubiquitously expressed across multiple organ systems, exerts neuroprotective effects by maintaining intracellular homeostasis and mitigating neuronal damage triggered by oxidative stress, inflammatory cascades, apoptotic signaling, and ischemic insults. Furthermore, GLP-1R activity is modulated by gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid abundance, implicating the gut-brain axis in its regulatory influence on neurological function. This review systematically examines the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CCH and highlights the therapeutic potential of GLP-1R activation. Specifically, GLP-1R-targeted interventions attenuate hypoperfusion-induced damage through pleiotropic pathways and gut-brain crosstalk, thereby offering novel perspectives for advancing both fundamental research and clinical management of neurocognitive disorders."

The inflammatory response following TBI plays a crucial role in patient outcomes, presenting both protective and potentially detrimental effects. This narrative review examines the current evidence regarding the role of nutritional supplements in modulating the inflammatory response after TBI. Recent research has demonstrated that various nutritional interventions, including probiotics, immunonutrition formulas, vitamin D, and taurine supplementation, can significantly influence inflammatory markers and clinical outcomes. Probiotics have shown particular promise in reducing inflammatory mediators and infection rates, while also decreasing hospital and ICU length of stay. Immunonutrition, especially through vitamin D supplementation, demonstrates significant effects on consciousness levels and ventilation requirements. The timing of nutritional intervention emerges as critical, with the early post-injury period (24-72 h) representing a crucial window for therapeutic intervention. The gut-brain axis appears central to these effects, with nutritional supplements potentially modulating both central and systemic inflammatory responses. While these interventions show promising results in reducing inflammatory markers and improving short-term outcomes, their impact on mortality rates remains limited. Future research should focus on optimizing nutritional protocols, understanding individual patient factors, and investigating long-term functional outcomes. This review supports a paradigm shift in approaching nutritional support in TBI, transitioning from viewing it as merely supportive care to recognizing it as an active therapeutic intervention that can significantly influence patient outcomes."

The review also explores the gut-brain axis, highlighting how EMF-derived polysaccharides improve gut health by modulating microbiota, potentially mitigating depressive symptoms. Additionally, it discusses the use of EMFs in functional foods and dietary supplements, innovations like 3D food printing for depression-related issues, and synthetic biology for enhancing compound production. Artificial intelligence is used to model complex mechanisms. However, challenges remain, such as standardization and lack of clinical validation.

While we have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the programming effects of early-life stress (ES), these are not yet fully understood and often hard to target, making the development of effective interventions challenging. In recent years, we and others have suggested that nutrition might be instrumental in modulating and possibly combatting the ES-induced increased risk to psychopathologies and neurobehavioral impairments. Nutritional strategies are very promising as they might be relatively safe, cheap and easy to implement. Here, we set out to comprehensively review the existing literature on nutritional interventions aimed at counteracting the effects of ES on neurobehavioral outcomes in preclinical and clinical settings. We identified eighty six rodent and ten human studies investigating a nutritional intervention to ameliorate ES-induced impairments. The human evidence to date, is too few and heterogeneous in terms of interventions, thus not allowing hard conclusions, however the preclinical studies, despite their heterogeneity in terms of designs, interventions used, and outcomes measured, showed nutritional interventions to be promising in combatting ES-induced impairments. Furthermore, we discuss the possible mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of nutrition on the brain after ES, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation and the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Lastly, we highlight the critical gaps in our current knowledge and make recommendations for future research to move the field forward."

        "abstract": "Anxiety and depression are two major contributors to global disease burden. Amongst various causal factors, exposure to even low doses of environmental heavy metals, like arsenic, can induce anxiety and depression-like behaviour in mammals. Ingestion of arsenic, primarily through contaminated drinking water, severely disrupts the gut microbes, thereby inducing structural and functional abnormalities in the brain. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from arsenic-exposed mice to recipient healthy mice (As-FMT) enriched LPS-secreting Gram-negative bacteria and upregulated the expression of TLR4 in intestinal epithelial cells. Consequently, inflammation, oxidative stress and compromised barrier integrity in the gut facilitated LPS translocation into the bloodstream and promoted systemic inflammation. The secretomes eventually affected the brain by activating microglia, altering neurotransmitter levels and reducing the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression, contributing to appearance of pyknotic nuclei in dentate gyrus of hippocampus and emergence of anxiety- and depression-like behaviour. Luteolin, a flavonoid, devoid of any apparent side-effects, yet known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, showed potential in alleviating the gut-brain toxic effects. However, its limited solubility and bioavailability pose challenges for its effectiveness, for which chitosan-conjugated luteolin gold nanoparticles (CH-LuAuNPs) were synthesized. Interestingly, where FMT from arsenic-treated mice to healthy mice showed deleterious effects in the transplanted mice, FMT from arsenic-treated mice co-administered with CH-LuAuNP attenuated As-FMT-mediated disruption of the gut-brain axis. This study highlighted the critical contribution of healthy gut microbiota in preserving neurobehavioural physiology, as well as underscored the potential therapeutic benefits of luteolin nanoparticles in ameliorating arsenic-induced gut dysbiosis and consequent mental disorders."

Interestingly, signaling pathways linked to several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to be involved in the pathology both of CNS disorders including neurodegenerative diseases and/or immune-related diseases. Oxidative stress and inflammation are likely to contribute to cell damage and death in these disorders, which in turn could cause mitochondrial injury. Interestingly, it has been revealed that gut microbiota could play a significant role in changing the phenotype of various neuron and/or immune-related disorders. Remarkably, GPCR signaling has been recognized as a key upstream regulator for autophagy/mitophagy via the action of the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. In addition, adjusting the composition of gut microbiota could be applied to modulate the autophagy/mitophagy by the alteration of GPCR signaling to ameliorate the mitochondrial injury. Collectively, this approach may contribute to the innovative development of promising therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases and/or immune-related diseases.

Experimental approaches, including a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model in mice, cellular assays, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), were used to evaluate the composite's effectiveness. Results indicate that GP activates the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway by upregulating BCL2, enhancing intestinal barrier integrity, and balancing gut flora. These mechanisms contribute to its positive effects on hippocampal function and depressive-like behaviors in mice, suggesting that the GP-NCC composite could be a promising avenue for developing depression therapies that target gut health."

So far, several clinical studies investigated bPBM therapy, at various parameters, both in patients with AD and related dementia, and PD. All demonstrate bPBM safety and bring valuable clinical information regarding efficacy, with particularly promising results in AD. However, their exploratory design and inconsistent quality lead to a low level of evidence, which currently does not support the widespread use of bPBM in clinical practice. Future clinical research should address two gaps: the need for robust double-blinded RCTs vs sham with a higher number of patients and a longer follow-up, and the need for research focusing on dosimetry to determine which bPBM parameters are optimal. The ongoing or unpublished clinical studies on bPBM should fill in this gap."

OSA patients may exhibit significant memory declines, including impairments in working memory from visual and verbal sources. The underlying mechanisms behind OSA-related memory impairment are complex and multifactorial with poorly understood aspects that require further investigation. Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal damage, synaptic plasticity, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, as observed under exposures to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation are likely contributors to learning and memory dysfunction. Continuous positive airway pressure treatment can provide remarkable relief from memory impairment in OSA patients. Other treatments are emerging but need to be rigorously evaluated for cognitive improvement. Clinically, reliable and objective diagnostic tools are necessary for accurate diagnosis and clinical characterization of cognitive impairments in OSA patients. The complex links between gut-brain axis, epigenetic landscape, genetic susceptibility, and OSA-induced memory impairments suggest new directions for research.

Astaxanthin (ASTA), a naturally occurring antioxidant, has garnered interest as a potential therapeutic agent for various diseases, particularly in mitigating oxidative stress. This study explores a novel application of ASTA in the context of ADHD, aiming to investigate its therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), widely used ADHD model animals, were treated with ASTA (50/100 mg/kg/day) for three weeks, 5 mg/kg/day atomoxetine (ATO) as the positive, and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats as control. Behavioral improvements were assessed using the open field test (OFT) and the Morris water maze (MWM). Biochemical analyses were conducted to evaluate changes in the levels of various neurotrophic factors, while histological examinations were performed to assess neuroprotective effects. Additionally, the role of ASTA in the brain-gut axis was investigated. The behavioral symptoms of hyperactivity, anxiety, and impaired spatial memory in ADHD animals were mitigated by ASTA. This improvement is primarily attributed to the restoration of neurotransmitter levels, particularly dopamine (DA), achieved through the modulation of several critical components within the dopamine system, including dopamine receptor 1 (DR1), dopamine transporter (DAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and synaptic-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25). Additionally, regulating the serotonin transporter (SERT) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) supports the recovery of serotonin levels and facilitates optimal brain development. Furthermore, cerebellar cells were protected, and the structure of the intestinal microbiota was regulated. ASTA can mitigate ADHD symptoms in SHR through the modulation of the dopaminergic system, multiple neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, and the neuro-intestinal environment, which establishes ASTA as a promising nutraceutical candidate for adjunctive therapy in pediatric ADHD."

The dysregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and the gut-brain axis underlies several stress related disorders, leading to systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, dysbiosis, and impaired gut barrier integrity. This review emphasizes the growing significance of probiotics as a potential treatment strategy for addressing chronic stress. Probiotics are living bacteria that provide health benefits when consumed in sufficient quantities, acting via several processes including restoration of gut microbial composition, augmentation of gut barrier integrity, and synthesis bioactive compounds such as neurotransmitters and short-chain fatty acids. These effects lead to reduced systemic and neuroinflammation, enhanced neuroplasticity, and the regulation of stress responsive pathways, including the HPA axis. Moreover, probiotics enhance parasympathetic nervous system activity by modulating vagus signaling. Current review indicates the promise of probiotics in alleviating chronic stress; nonetheless, substantial gaps exist regarding strain specific benefits, appropriate doses, and long-term safety. It is essential to address these constraints by comprehensive, large scale clinical studies and tailored therapies.

Within this narrative review, the vital physiological functions of SCFAs were examined, with emphasis on butyrate's role as an energy source for colonocytes and its ability to enhance the gut barrier while exhibiting anti-inflammatory effects. Knowledge of butyrate synthesis, primarily generated by Firmicutes bacteria, can be influenced by diets with specifically high contents of resistant starches and fiber. Butyrate can inhibit histone deacetylase, modulate gene expression, influence immune functionality, and regulate tight junction integrity, supporting the idea of its role in gut barrier preservation. Butyrate possesses systemic anti-inflammatory properties, particularly, its capacity to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and maintain immune homeostasis, highlighting its therapeutic potential in managing dysbiosis and inflammatory diseases. Although butyrate absorption into circulation is typically minimal, its broader health implications are substantial, especially regarding obesity and type 2 diabetes through its influence on metabolic regulation and inflammation. Furthermore, this narrative review thoroughly examines butyrate's growing recognition as a modulator of neurological health via its interaction with the gut-brain axis. Additionally, butyrate's neuroprotective effects are mediated through activation of specific G-protein-coupled receptors, such as FFAR3 and GPR109a, and inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Research indicates that butyrate can alleviate neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autism spectrum disorder, and Huntington's disease, by reducing neuroinflammation, enhancing neurotransmitter modulation, and improving histone acetylation. This focus will help unlock its full therapeutic potential for metabolic and neurological health, rather than exclusively on its well-known benefits for gut health, as these are often interconnected."

Phenotypes are grafted onto this complexity, the recognition of which allows for personalized medicine and increasingly targeted therapies. Although there are no standardized treatment protocols, we present management options consisting of lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapies. Nutritional advice and encouragement of adequate physical activity lead to increased self-efficacy and promote a sense of well-being when coupled with psychological approaches involving mindful eating.

A key pathological feature of PD is the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein (aSyn) protein in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Aggregation of aSyn can form Lewy Bodies that contribute to dopaminergic neuron degeneration and motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Beyond the central nervous system (CNS), aSyn aggregates have been detected in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, suggesting a link between peripheral aSyn and non-motor PD symptoms. GI symptoms, often preceding motor symptoms by up to 20 years, highlight the bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system (gut-brain axis) in PD. Although microbiome alterations and intestinal inflammation have been associated with PD, functional impacts on gut-brain signaling or aSyn aggregation remain unclear. Intestinal neuropeptides are key modulators of gut-brain communication, alter immune response to pathogens and environmental toxins, and may contribute to function of the luminal gut barrier. Dysregulation of gut neuropeptide signaling including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and substance P (SP) have been associated pathologic effects of PD in animal models. Despite their potential role in pathogenesis and disease modulation, gut neuropeptide roles in PD are under explored. This manuscript reviews current knowledge surrounding microbial metabolite and immune influences on gut neuropeptide signaling, aSyn aggregation in the enteric nervous system, and downstream neuroimmune pathway alterations within the context of PD and its mouse models."

Effects of growth-stage air pollution exposure on the gut microbiome, host metabolites, and brain tissue were assessed. Pathological damage in the hippocampus and cortex was observed. Fecal metagenomic sequencing revealed alterations in both compositions and functions of the gut microbiome. Metabolic disturbances in unsaturated fatty acids and glycerophospholipids were identified in the intestine, serum, and brain tissues, with significant changes in metabolites (e.g., gamma-linolenic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS). Serum levels of the pro-inflammatory mediator leukotriene C4 were also elevated. Correlation analysis identified a group of different gut microbiome species that were associated with host metabolites. Furthermore, mediation analysis showed that intestinal and serum metabolites mediated the associations between the key gut microbiome and brain microbiome. These findings indicate that the metabolic crosstalk in the gut-brain axis mediates the neuronal damage in mice induced by growth-stage air pollution exposure, potentially through pathways involving lipid metabolism and inflammation."

This review systematically synthesizes current evidence to elucidate the neuroimmune axis in CRC pathogenesis, with particular emphasis on neuroimmune crosstalk-mediated remodeling of tumor immunity. We comprehensively catalog the immunomodulatory effects exerted by principal neuroregulatory mediators, categorized as: (1) neurotransmitters (glutamate, glutamine, γ-aminobutyric acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and gaseous signaling molecules); (2) neuropeptides (substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide); and (3) neurotrophic factors.

Research indicates that PBM applied to the oral cavity could selectively alter microbial composition. This alteration may, via the oral-gut microbiome axis, indirectly impact gut health. This hypothesis, supported by preliminary studies, suggests that oral PBM could offer a promising non-invasive strategy for managing gut-related disorders. Furthermore, there may be a link between the oral microbiome and brain diseases.

Also, in the activity-based anorexia (ABA) animal model mimicking AN brain volume loss is observed. This study investigated the impact of chronic starvation on brain cell populations and evaluated the potential protective effects of omega-3 fatty acids (FA) and probiotics in rats. We used a chronic ABA model and provided daily oral supplementation of omega-3 FA and probiotics. Immunohistochemistry and qPCR were used to analyze GFAP-positive astrocytes, IBA1-positive microglia, OLIG1/2-positive oligodendrocytes, MAP2-positive neurons and Ki-67-positive proliferating cells in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum. We found a significant reduction of astrocytes and microglia in all ABA groups, likely due to reduced proliferating cells. Reduced running wheel activity and reduced amount of food needed to sustain body weight were observed in animals with supplementation with omega-3 FA and probiotics but we did not observe alterations in brain cells that could be attributed to these supplementations. Our results indicate that glial cell depletion potentially underlies the diminished brain volume found in ABA rats. Omega-3 FA and probiotics show potential for reducing AN-related symptoms and merit further study as a therapeutic approach."

The analysis focused on microbiota composition (45 patients), serum metabolomics and inflammatory markers (20 patients). The patients with SS exhibited more pronounced insulin resistance associated with increased levels of branched-chain amino acids and their metabolites. SS patients showed an increase in inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, and surprisingly an increase in IL-10 and butyrate which are anti-inflammatory. SS patients also displayed a distinct microbiota profile, with statistically significant differences in β-diversity compared to the MS group, notably a higher prevalence of Pseudomonadota (formerly Proteobacteria). In summary, our data indicate that patients with SS, compared to those with MS, are characterized by a more inflammatory and insulin-resistant state, associated with three key regulators: microbiota, metabolites, and interleukins. These findings provide new insights into the regulatory components of the gut-brain axis, which could be developed into cost-effective and widely accessible therapies for SS."

A population of cells belonging to the ENS, called enteric glial cells (EGCs), appears to actively participate in this communication between the intestine and the brain, but acting in a dualistic manner, sometimes in reactive gliosis releasing inflammatory mediators, sometimes promoting homeostasis and resilience in the face of inflammatory injuries. To date, the intracellular mechanisms that define the transcriptional profile expressed in EGCs in each situation have not yet been elucidated.

However, the role of C3G in alleviating natural aging-induced cognitive impairment and the underlying mechanisms thereof remain unclear. In this study, experimental methods mainly included biochemical analysis, pathological analysis, immunofluorescence staining, transmission electron microscopy analysis, western blot, as well as the determination of the gut microbiota composition and detection of metabolites. We found that C3G may exert neuroprotective effects and promote brain health by alleviating brain atrophy and neuroinflammation, enhancing brain antioxidant capacity, regulating neurotransmitter expression and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and attenuating blood-brain barrier and hippocampal synaptic damage. Furthermore, C3G also promotes gut health by decreasing inflammatory responses and intestinal tissue crypt damage, upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins, and attenuating intestinal damage. Notably, C3G regulated the microbiota composition in different intestinal segments and intestinal mucosa, as well as the metabolic homeostasis of gut microbiota metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), amino acids, and bile acids. Substantially increased levels of SCFAs could activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway by acting on the G protein-coupled receptors. Correlation analysis indicated that increased gut microbiota, such as Faecalibaculum and Bifidobacterium, and elevated SCFAs were positively correlated with behavioral improvement and brain health.

Grain polyphenols are widely recognized as natural active ingredients with high potential to treat chronic diseases due to their excellent postprandial hyperglycemic regulating effects. However, previous studies on polyphenols in grains mainly focused on the functional properties of free polyphenols and the extraction and physicochemical properties of bound polyphenols, ignoring the functional properties of bound polyphenols. Comprehensively understanding the binding properties of grain bound polyphenols (GBPs) and their mechanisms in regulating blood glucose levels is essential for developing and applying grain resources. This review summarizes the molecular interactions between GBPs and grain components and their effects on release characteristics and bioavailability at various stages. Meanwhile, the review focuses on elucidating the regulatory mechanism of post-release GBPs on postprandial hyperglycemia levels, incorporating insights from molecular docking, the gastrointestinal-brain axis, and gut flora. GBPs slow food digestion by occupying the active site of digestive enzymes and altering the secondary structure of enzymes and the hydrophobic environment of amino acid residues to inhibit enzyme activity. They modulate intestinal epithelial transport proteins (SGLT1, GLUT2, and GLUT4) to limit glucose absorption and increase glucose consumption. They also stimulate the release of short-term satiety hormones (CKK, GLP-1, and PYY) through the gastrointestinal-brain axis to decrease post-meal food intake. Furthermore, they optimize gut microbiota composition, promoting short-chain fatty acid production and bile acid metabolism. Therefore, developing functional foods with glucose-modulating properties based on GBPs is crucial for obesity prevention, diabetes management, and low-GI food development."

However, their impact on gut microbiota is still poorly defined, and studies on the role of other polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as conjugated linoleic and linolenic acids, are even scarcer.\nMETHODS: By using an in vitro human fermentation model, we assessed the effect of omega-3, CLA isomers, and punicic acid on microbiota modulation.\nRESULTS: Fish oil, Omega-3, and CLA samples positively impact Akkermansia spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. growth. Moreover, all the samples supported Roseburia spp. growth after 24 h of fermentation and, importantly, they were able to maintain the Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes ratio near 1. All the bioactive fatty acid samples, except Pomegranate oil, were able to significantly increase butyrate levels compared to those found in the positive control (FOS) sample. Moreover, Fish oil and Omega-3 samples were able to increase the concentration of GABA, alanine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, and leucine between 12 and 24 h of fermentation.\nCONCLUSIONS: The impact of the assessed polyunsaturated fatty acids in gut microbiota has been observed in its impact on key bacteria (Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, and Roseburia) as well as their metabolic byproducts, including butyrate and amino acids, which could potentially play a role in modulating the gut-brain axis."

Large-scale, standardized clinical trials are crucial for understanding the therapeutic potential and limitations of gut microbiota interventions. A deeper understanding of the gut-hypertension axis could lead to novel, personalized treatment strategies for hypertension."

However, comprehensive reviews integrating the diverse therapeutic effects of probiotics in human subjects have been limited. By analyzing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, this review provides a comprehensive overview of key developments in probiotic interventions targeting gut, liver, skin, vaginal, mental, and oral health. Emerging evidence supports the efficacy of specific probiotic strains and combinations in treating a wide range of disorders, from gastrointestinal (GI) and liver diseases to dermatological conditions, bacterial vaginosis, mental disorders, and oral diseases. We discuss the expanding understanding of microbiome-organ connections underlying probiotic mechanisms of action. While many clinical trials demonstrate significant benefits, we acknowledge areas requiring further large-scale studies to establish definitive efficacy and optimal treatment protocols. The review addresses challenges in standardizing probiotic research methodologies and emphasizes the importance of considering individual variations in microbiome composition and host genetics. Additionally, we explore emerging concepts such as the oral-gut-brain axis and future directions, including high-resolution microbiome profiling, host-microbe interaction studies, organoid models, and artificial intelligence applications in probiotic research. Overall, this review offers a comprehensive update on the current state of therapeutic probiotics across multiple domains of human health, providing insights into future directions and the potential for probiotics to revolutionize preventive and therapeutic medicine."

Despite previous evidence indicating that the microbiota-gut-brain axis is critically involved in many neurological disorders, no research has hitherto established a connection between the gut microbiota and PCABI through this axis. This study aims to explore the biological roles of microbial tryptophan metabolites in the progression of PCABI.\nMETHODS: To achieve this, we pretreated rats with a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx) to eradicate the gut microbiota before establishing a 7-min asphyxia-CA/CPR model.\nRESULTS: Remarkably, the 24-h survival rate and neurological outcomes improved in Abx/CPR rats. Fecal 16s rDNA sequencing and PICRUSt2 analysis revealed that Abx reshaped the microbial community and elevated the proportion of microbial tryptophan metabolism in rats. Metabolomic profiling suggested that Abx shifted the phenotype of microbial tryptophan metabolism from the indole pathway to the kynurenine pathway, thereby increasing the levels of the neuroprotective metabolite kynurenine in the feces, circulation, and ultimately the brain. Furthermore, the hippocampal expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), an endogenous receptor of kynurenine, was upregulated in Abx/CPR rats. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects of kynurenine are AhR-dependent and that AhR activation could negatively regulate the NLRP3 protein expression. Supporting this, results from qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence in the rat cerebral cortex exhibited that L-kynurenine inhibited NLRP3-induced pyroptosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a direct clue to the essential participation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the progression of PCABI. It demonstrates that kynurenine might attenuate PCABI by inhibiting NLRP3-induced pyroptosis."

To better understand causal relationships between genotype and disease phenotypes, a genetically tractable model, zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged.

Novel mechanisms of Cd toxicity include the gut-brain axis, ionic antagonism, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and epigenetics, leading to potential therapeutics such as probiotics, selenium, and antioxidants. Based on the reviewed literature, more studies should examine the effects of dietary Cd on zebrafish behavior, brains, and cardiovascular function. Given that humans and wildlife are chronically exposed to Cd, leading to gonadal Cd accumulation, studies should conduct early-life exposures across the zebrafish lifespan and assess endpoints across generations to capture germline and epigenetic effects and mechanisms. The zebrafish's biomedical toolkit, along with high-content screening, should be utilized to develop and refine therapies."

Comorbid conditions such as cognitive impairment, epilepsy, psychiatric diseases, and behavioral symptoms such as impaired social communication, repetitive behaviors, lack of interest in the environment, nutritional disorders, gastrointestinal diseases and abnormal (dysbiotic) states, sleep disorders, and dysmorphism are frequently encountered in individuals with ASD. Although nutrition is one of the environmental factors affecting ASD, it can also be effective in alleviating the behavioral and gastrointestinal symptoms of ASD. Various dietary models (GFCF diet, low glycemic index diet, ketogenic diet, specific carbohydrate diet, Mediterranean diet, GAPS, Feingold, Candida body ecology, allergy elimination diets, etc.) and supplements (vitamin D, polyunsaturated fatty acids, probiotics and prebiotics, phytochemicals) can be used to alleviate symptoms in individuals with ASD. The effectiveness and reliability of dietary interventions in individuals with ASD are a matter of significant debate, and the evidence for these practices is limited.

Such microbial changes are thought to contribute to neurodegenerative changes, as observed in AD and cognitive decline, thus emphasizing the role of the microbiome in aging-related neurological health. Our study in urban and rural population in Uganda recruited 104 participants aged 60 years and older, categorized into AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and control groups based on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and ICD-11/DSM-V criteria. DNA was extracted from fecal samples using a QIAamp kit and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were sequenced using Nanopore. We used diversity indices, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LefSe) to identify significant microbial differences among groups. Gut microbiome diversity, as measured by the Chao1 and Shannon indices, was significantly reduced in patients with AD. The AD group had the lowest diversity compared to that of the control group (P < .05). PCoA showed distinct microbial shifts between patients with AD and controls, with MCI showing an intermediate profile. Genera such as Novosphingobium and Staphylococcus were more prevalent in the controls, whereas Hafnia-Obesumbacterium and Dickeya were more common in AD. Age-related changes included increases in Exiguobacterium and Carnobacterium and decreases in Acinetobacter and Klebsiella.

Edaravone (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one, EDA) is widely utilized neuroprotective medication for ischemic stroke in Japan, China, India, and other countries. However, the effects of EDA on peripheral inflammation and gut-brain axis repair post-stroke have not been revealed yet. In this study, we employed network pharmacology to identify the potential anti-inflammatory targets and signaling pathways that EDA may influence in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Then, we used 16S rDNA sequencing and molecular docking techniques to determine whether the anti-inflammatory effects of EDA are dependent on the gut-brain axis. Using morphological and molecular biology methods, we investigate how EDA reduces inflammatory response after ischemic stroke through gut microbiota and its metabolites. We demonstrated that EDA alleviated central and peripheral inflammation and rescued gut microbiota dysbiosis post-stroke. Meanwhile, EDA also improved intestinal histological features and decreased intestinal inflammation of post-stroke. The network pharmacology, 16S rDNA sequencing, and molecular docking results revealed that EDA could bind with the ESR1 and thereby regulate the expression of CYP1A1. Furthermore, EDA regulated CYP1A1-related metabolism and decreased the level of 20-HETE post-stroke through gut microbiota. Our study confirmed that EDA alleviated central and peripheral inflammation post-stroke by inhibiting CYP1A1 and CYP1A1-related metabolic through gut microbiota.

While the gut-brain axis and key regulators like 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and butyrate are known to play crucial roles in these conditions, the mechanisms underlying their comorbidities remain unclear. Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San (SLBZS), a traditional herbal formula, is effective in treating FGIDs. Still, the specific components and mechanisms mediating its therapeutic effects via the gut-brain axis are not well understood.\nMETHODS: This study identified molecular links among FDr, IBS-D, and FD from the gut-brain axis using integrated biological information. The pharmacological mechanisms of SLBZS were explored through network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and in vitro bio-layer interferometry (BLI) validation.\nRESULTS: A total of 328 common targets were identified among FDr, IBS-D, and FD, with 22 hub genes in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network associated with 5-HT/DA/butyrate pathways. Virtual screening revealed seven key targets (AKT1, CASP3, VEGFA, INS, CTNNB1, PTGS2, and IL1B) and 14 bioactive components (e.g., diosgenin and luteolin) from SLBZS. Molecular docking indicated strong binding affinities between key components and targets, while molecular dynamics simulations confirmed stable interactions, particularly between PTGS2 and diosgenin/luteolin. BLI experiments further validated the strong binding affinity of PTGS2 for diosgenin.\nCONCLUSION: This study elucidates potential targets shared by FDr, IBS-D, and FD through the gut-brain axis, highlighting diosgenin's interaction with PTGS2 as a potential mechanism of SLBZS's therapeutic effects.

Adoptive transfer experiments assessed the impact of stool-derived EVs from PTS mice on inflammasome signaling in recipient naïve 3xTg and WT mice. At 3 days, 3xTg-PTS mice demonstrated significantly impaired sensorimotor Rotarod performance compared to WT-PTS mice. Both WT and 3xTg PTS mice had deficits compared to 3xTg and WT sham mice using the Open Field or Novel Object Recognition tests.

Accumulating evidence suggests that oxidative distress may contribute to osteoporosis. This review thoroughly outlines the relationships among osteoporosis, redox homeostasis, and alcohol addiction, since these relations are not sufficiently known and subsequently summarized. The brain-bone axis plays a crucial role in alcohol-induced damage to the nervous and skeletal systems. Alterations in the nervous system can lead to osteoporosis because the central nervous system is involved in bone remodeling through various neural pathways. Conversely, as an endocrine organ, bone secretes a number of bone-derived factors (osteokines), which can influence brain function and behavior. As a result, osteoporosis is more common in individuals with neurological disorders, and sudden neurological events can rapidly increase the risk of osteoporosis. Excessive alcohol consumption is linked to many neurological complications, as well as osteoporosis, which are manifested by disrupted redox homeostasis, inflammation, neurodegeneration, inhibition of neurogenesis, decreased bone mineral density, impaired bone microarchitecture, altered mineral homeostasis, raising fracture risk, hormonal dysregulation, and altered gut microbiota composition. Compared to men, alcohol dependence has more negative consequences for women, including an increased risk of liver, cardiovascular, metabolic, mental disorders, and breast cancer. Abstinence has been demonstrated to improve bone and brain health in alcohol addiction. The discovery of the brain-bone axis may lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches for alcohol and other substance addictions.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anacyclus pyrethrum (l.) DC has potential value in treating Parkinson's disease (PD)-mild cognitive impairment (MCI), manifesting as impaired memory, attention, executive function, and language. However, the specific targets and modes of action of A. pyrethrum remain unclear.\nPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify the active components of A. pyrethrum and examine their effectiveness in treating a mouse model of PD-MCI.\nMETHODS: We generated ethanol extracts of A. pyrethrum root (EEAP) and identified its active components and related targets using UHPLC-MS/MS and network pharmacology.The PD-MCI model was induced via intraperitoneal administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine(MPTP). After following continuous administration of EEAP,Altered learning or memory, as well as anxiety, were tested using the morris water maze, eight-arm radial arm maze (RAM), and open-field test,elevated plus-maze. Brain histopathology and ultrastructural changes were examined using brightfield microscopy, and electron microscopy, respectively. Furthermore, protein expression was assessed using western blotting.Stool samples were used for metabolomics analysis by UHPLC-MS/MS and for 16S rDNA sequencing to determine the compositional changes of the gut microbiota.We conducted a short-chain fatty acid targeted metabolomics experiment to study their role in the gut-brain axis in PD-MCI.\nRESULTS: Using UPLC-MS-MS, 126 compounds were identified from A. pyrethrum samples.After searching the databases and literature reports, 31 active components and 544 drug-disease targets were screened. Biological processes and molecular functions, such as energy channels, cell signaling, and metabolism, were discovered through GO analysis. The water maze experiment showed that the average swimming distance and escape latency of mice in EEAP groups decreased. The eight-arm maze experiment showed that model had a much higher number of errors related to working memory than the control mice. In the open field experiment, compared with the control group, the mice in the EEAP group exhibited an increase in the average movement speed and total movement distance, along with a decrease in the residence time.In the elevated plus maze, the control had less anxiety than the Model. Donepezil/Levodopa(D/l) mitigated anxiety-like behavior, and EEAP (100-400 mg/kg) showed a dose-dependent increase in open-arm metrics, suggesting it may ease anxiety in mice.Hippocampal tissue of mice treated with different doses of EEAP showed intact cellular layers and the hematoxylin-eosin-stained cones were slightly better;cells were arranged neatly; their morphology was normal, and were distributed uniformly. Electron microscopy revealed that the nuclear membrane, chromatin, and nucleoli were clearly demarcated in the hippocampus of mice treated with different doses of EEAP, contrary to that in the model group. In brain extracts of the EEAP group, lighter thinner bands for amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ were observed compared to those in the model group. In model mice, APP and Aβ protein expression was higher than in the blank group, as shown by stronger bands. In EEAP-treated mice, the bands were weaker, indicating reduced expression. In the model group had lower Bcl-2 and higher Bax levels. EEAP treatment increased Bcl-2 and decreased Bax expression.Compared to the control group, the model showed substantially low glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px),superoxide dismutase(SOD),catalase (CAT)activity (p < 0.05),much higher (p < 0.05) in the EEAP-H group than that in the model. EEAP intervention significantly modulated the fecal metabolic profile of PD-MCI mice. The abundance of steroid and lipid metabolites, including linoleylethanolamine, was markedly altered in the model group compared to the control group, with EEAP treatment reversing several of these abnormalities. PLS-DA and OPLS-DA revealed significant separation between groups (Q2= 0.542, p < 0.01), confirming a dose-dependent effect. Random forest analysis identified 15 key metabolic markers, such as dose-dependent changes in d-glutamine and hydrocodone. Metabolic pathway analysis demonstrated significant enrichment in phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis pathways (p < 0.05). The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved an AUC approaching 1, indicating substantial differences in metabolite profiles. EEAP intervention significantly influenced the composition and functional profile of the intestinal microbiota. The Venn diagram illustrates that each group shared 342 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), with the EEAP 400 group exhibiting a distinct Bacteroidetes proportion. LEfSe analysis identified g_Prevotella as the characteristic bacterium in the control group, c_Epsilonproteobacteria in the model group, and g_Adlercreutzia in the EEAP 100 group. The Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) index was highest in the EEAP 100 group, and Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS)/Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) revealed significant differences in microbial community structure. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analysis indicated that acetic acid was the predominant metabolite, while EEAP dose-dependently regulated propionic acid and isovaleric acid levels (VIP > 1, p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that EEAP exerts its regulatory effects by reshaping the structure and metabolic functions of the gut microbiota.\nCONCLUSION: EEAP holds great promise as a potential therapeutic agent for PD-MCI, exerting its effects through multiple mechanisms, including regulating protein expression, modulating the fecal metabolic profile, and reshaping the gut microbiota and its metabolites."

        "abstract": "Depression is strongly linked to dysfunctions in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Jasmine tea, a traditional Chinese beverage made by combining green tea with Jasminum sambac, has potential antidepressant effects. However, its potential to alleviate depression via modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis remains largely unstudied. In this study, we used a rat model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to investigate the effects of jasmine tea extract (JT) on depression-related symptoms. Behavioral assessments, inflammatory marker analysis, hippocampal histology, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression assays demonstrated that JT alleviated depressive behaviors, reduced brain tissue damage, and restored cognitive function in CUMS-exposed rats. JT also significantly reduced intestinal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and modulated oxidative stress markers (MDA, SOD, and CAT), suggesting a role in preserving intestinal integrity. Further, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that JT shifted the gut microbiota composition in favor of beneficial bacteria such as Romboutsia, Blautia, and Monoglobus, while decreasing the abundance of potentially harmful bacteria, including Bifidobacterium, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, and Escherichia-Shigella. Meanwhile, non-targeted and targeted metabolomics analyses showed that JT influenced key metabolic pathways involving tryptophan, short-chain fatty acids, and bile acids, helping to restore metabolic balance across various tissues (feces, colon, serum, and cerebral cortex) in the depressed rats. These findings indicate that JT may alleviate depression by modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis, highlighting its potential as a dietary intervention for depression management."

Emerging evidence indicates a more significant role for the microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA) in SUDs than previously recognized. The MGBA is interconnected with various body systems by producing numerous metabolites, most importantly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), cytokines, and neurotransmitters. These mediators influence the human body's epigenome and transcriptome. While numerous epigenetic alterations in different brain regions have been reported in SUD models, the intricate relationship between SUDs and the MGBA suggests that the gut microbiome may partially contribute to the underlying mechanisms of SUDs. Promising results have been observed with gut microbiome-directed interventions in patients with SUDs, including prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. Nonetheless, the long-term epigenetic effects of these interventions remain unexplored. Moreover, various confounding factors and study limitations have hindered the identification of molecular mechanisms and clinical applications of gut microbiome interventions in SUDs. In the present review, we will (i) provide a comprehensive discussion on how the gut microbiome influences SUDs, with an emphasis on epigenetic alterations; (ii) discuss the current evidence on the bidirectional relationship of gut microbiome and SUDs, highlighting potential targets for intervention; and (iii) review recent advances in gut microbiome-directed therapies, along with their limitations and future directions."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder, is marked by the progressive deteriorations in learning and memory capabilities. The microbiota-gut-brain axis has come to be regarded as a crucial element in relation to the pathogenesis as well as the treatment of AD. Eucommiae cortex polysaccharides (EPs), being among the most plentiful substances present in the Eucommiae cortex, show the potential to exert immunomodulatory and neuroprotective function. However, whether EPs are protective against AD and their mechanism of action remain to be investigated OBJECTIVES: We hypothesize that EPs can regulate brain glutamine metabolism through gut microbiota and the butyric acid metabolized by them, improve oxidative stress and autophagy in the brain, and thus alleviate AD.\nMETHODS: In the present study, we used EPs (0.25 % w/w in food) and fecal microbiota transplantation, as well as butyrate supplementation (0.1 M in water), to intervene in AD mice. Multi-omics were used to determine the mechanism by which EPs improve AD-related learning and memory impairments.\nRESULTS: Our results suggest that EPs, functioning as a prebiotic, alleviated learning and memory impairments in AD mice. Mechanistically, EPs are able to reshape the gut microbiota, promote the growth of gut microbiota involved in short-chain fatty acid metabolism, particularly butyrate-producing microbes. The butyrate produced by these microbes improves the brain microenvironment by modulating oxidative stress and autophagy mediated by brain glutamate metabolism, improving learning and memory impairments in AD mice, and inhibiting the formation and deposition of beta-amyloid proteins. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and butyrate supplementation further confirm this conclusion.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results highlighted that EPs can alleviate learning and memory impairments in AD with a gut microbiota-dependent manner and that butyric acid metabolized by butyric acid-metabolizing bacteria in the gut plays a central role in regulating brain glutamine metabolism to improve brain microenvironmental homeostasis. Meanwhile, the present study provides new insights into the treatment of AD with natural products."

While BA imbalances contribute to PD pathogenesis, the specific subspecies regulating α-synuclein (α-syn) homeostasis and their mechanisms in enteric neurons-critical sites for PD initiation-require systematic investigation.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate whether hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), a secondary BA with documented neuroprotective properties but unproven efficacy in synucleinopathy, modulates α-syn clearance through enteric neuronal autophagy to mitigate PD progression.\nMETHODS: A53T transgenic mice underwent behavioral assessments for PD phenotyping. State-of-the-art UPLC/MS-based metabolomics quantified BA profiles. Pharmacological interventions using target-specific inhibitors (Gly-MCA, T0070907, VER-155,008) dissected the FXR-PPARγ-HSPA8 pathway. Multiscale analyses spanning immunofluorescence, western blotting, and LC3B autophagy flux reporter assays elucidated α-syn aggregation and autophagic dynamics in primary enteric neurons.\nRESULTS: HDCA decline correlated with PD severity, positioning it as a novel biomarker for gut-brain axis dysfunction in PD. HDCA supplementation not only alleviated motor/non-motor deficits but also conferred dual neuroprotection-reducing colonic α-syn oligomers and preserving nigral dopaminergic neurons. Mechanistic decoding revealed HDCA's unparalleled capacity to activate enteric neuronal autophagy via FXR-PPARγ-HSPA8 signaling, a pathway previously unrecognized in PD therapeutics.\nCONCLUSION: Our study reveals a novel gut-brain axis where HDCA depletion drives PD pathogenesis via FXR-PPARγ-HSPA8-mediated autophagic dysfunction in enteric neurons. PD-associated HDCA deficiency directly impairs α-syn clearance, identifying HDCA as both a gut-derived synucleinopathy biomarker and a therapeutic target."

This study aimed to evaluate whether abdominal LIPUS could alleviate MK-801-induced schizophrenia-like negative symptoms through gut-brain communication.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Rats administered with MK-801 were treated daily for 5 days with either LIPUS or Lactobacillus plantarum PS128, while another group of MK-801-administered rats received no treatment. Following LIPUS or PS128 treatment, rats underwent behavioral testing, western blot analysis, and histological examination. Changes in the gut bacteria composition were examined through 16S rRNA sequencing analysis.\nSTUDY RESULTS: MK-801 administration reduced NMDAR1 and VGAT expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats, leading to an imbalance in the excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio. It also decreased 5-HT1AR and 5-HT2AR density, resulting in reduced concentrations of dopamine and serotonin (5-HT). This induced prepulse inhibition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal behaviors, accompanied by a reduction in gut microbiota diversity. Abdominal LIPUS stimulation effectively lessened the MK-801-induced reduction in gut microbiota diversity, restored NMDAR1, 5-HT1AR, and 5-HT2AR density, enhanced dopaminergic neuron activity, and increased dopamine and 5-HT release in the mPFC, thereby reversing behavioral abnormalities.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that abdominal LIPUS alleviates MK-801-induced schizophrenia-like negative symptoms by modulating serotonin signaling and the gut microbiota."

The gut microbiome, referring to the bacteria and microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal system, may be a viable target for intervention. This short review summarizes recent evidence linking the gut-brain axis to child developmental outcomes. We explore how lead-induced effects to the gut microbiome could indirectly affect child neurodevelopment, such that disrupting or offsetting this mediating process could buffer the effects of lead on child developmental outcomes. Unexpected findings with respect to child microbiota diversity and child cognitive and behavioral outcomes as well as lead exposure and adult microbiota diversity are discussed. When possible, we draw connections between observed changes to relative bacterial abundance, proposed bacterial functions, and downstream effects to brain development. We also explore how the gut microbiome might modify the toxicity of lead by impeding the uptake of lead across the gastrointestinal tract or through indirect mechanisms in such ways that the gut microbiome does not fit within a mediating pathway. In this case, promoting the buffering capacity of the gut microbiome may reduce the impacts of lead on child neurodevelopment.

Recent developments have drawn attention to the putative involvement of peripheral systems in the control of anxiety, and the gut microbiota has come to light as an emerging peripheral target for anxiety. The relationship between the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the central nervous system (CNS) and enteric nervous system (ENS), and anxiety has been the subject of some recent studies. Therefore, this systematic review analyzed clinical trials evaluating the potential of microbiome modulation methods in mitigating and ameliorating anxiety disorders. Clinical studies on probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotic supplements, dietary interventions, and fecal microbiota transplantation in anxiety disorders were screened. All of the studies examined the effects of probiotic intervention. One of these studies compared a prebiotic-rich diet with probiotic supplementation. Longitudinal analyses showed that the probiotic intervention alleviated anxiety. However, most of the controlled studies reported that the probiotic intervention did not make a difference compared to placebo. Thus, the current findings suggest that it is too early to consider the promising role of microbiome modulation in the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, it is obvious that more clinical research is needed to clarify issues such as probiotic strains, prebiotic types, and their doses that may be effective on anxiety disorders."

Emerging evidence suggests an association between bile acids (BAs) and CPP, although their regulatory roles and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.\nMETHODS: We conducted untargeted metabolomics and targeted BA analysis on serum samples from female rats with high-fat diet-induced CPP to identify metabolites potentially involved in regulating puberty through modulation of Sirt1 and Kiss1 expression in the hypothalamus. Identified BAs were then administered via gavage to female rats with CPP to assess their effects. To explore the mechanisms by which these BAs affect the development of CPP, gut microbiota and their metabolites were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics.\nRESULTS: Our findings revealed significant reductions in glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA) and glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) levels in female rats with CPP. GDCA treatment delayed the onset of puberty, accompanied by alterations in the gut microbiota functions and metabolic pathways related to oxidative stress (OS) and fatty acid metabolism. Mediation analysis suggested that OS-related metabolites, including gamma-glutamylcysteine and malonic acid, which increased with the abundance of Lachnospiraceae UCG-001, facilitated the reduction of Sirt1 expression. Additionally, pregnenolone appeared to suppress the beneficial effect of Parasutterella in enhancing Sirt1 expression.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that GDCA exhibits a potential therapeutic effect on CPP through a unique mechanism that involves gut microbiota modulation, alterations in serum metabolites, and changes in the expression of key regulatory factors Sirt1."

While immunotherapy and targeted treatments show promise, therapeutic resistance and disease progression remain major challenges. This is partly due to GBM's classification as a \"cold tumor\" with low mutational burden and a lack of distinct molecular targets for drug delivery that selectively spare healthy tissue. Emerging evidence highlights the gut microbiota as a key player in cancer biology, influencing both glioma development and treatment response. This review explores the intersectionality between the gut microbiome and GBM, beginning with an overview of microbiota composition and its broader implications in cancer pathophysiology. We then examine how specific microbial populations contribute to glioma oncogenesis, modulating immune responses, inflammation, and metabolic pathways that drive tumor initiation and progression. Additionally, we discuss the gut microbiome's role in glioma therapeutic resistance, including its impact on chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy efficacy. Given its influence on treatment outcomes, we evaluate emerging strategies to modulate gut flora, such as probiotics, dietary interventions, and microbiota-based therapeutics, to enhance therapy response in GBM patients. Finally, we address key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the need for standardized methodologies, mechanistic studies, and clinical trials to validate microbiota-targeted interventions in neuro-oncology.

Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been observed in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease and patients. Manipulating the composition of the gut microbiota enhances or delays neuropathology and cognitive deficits in mouse models. Accordingly, the health status of the animal facility may strongly influence these outcomes. In the present study, we longitudinally analyzed the fecal microbiota composition and amyloid pathology of 5XFAD mice housed in a specific opportunistic pathogen-free (SOPF) and a conventional facility. The composition of the microbiota of 5XFAD mice after aging in conventional facility showed marked differences compared to WT littermates that were not observed when the mice were bred in SOPF facility. The development of amyloid pathology was also enhanced by conventional housing. We then transplanted fecal microbiota (FMT) from both sources into wild-type (WT) mice and measured memory performance, assessed in the novel object recognition test, in transplanted animals. Mice transplanted with microbiota from conventionally bred 5XFAD mice showed impaired memory performance, whereas FMT from mice housed in SOPF facility did not induce memory deficits in transplanted mice. Finally, 18 weeks of housing SOPF-born animals in a conventional facility resulted in the reappearance of specific microbiota compositions in 5XFAD vs WT mice. In conclusion, these results show a strong impact of housing conditions on microbiota-associated phenotypes and question the relevance of breeding preclinical models in specific pathogen-free (SPF) facilities.\nIMPORTANCE: Housing conditions affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Gut microbiota of 6-month-old conventionally bred Alzheimer's mice is dysbiotic. Gut dysbiosis is absent in Alzheimer's mice housed in highly sanitized facilities. Transfer of fecal microbiota from conventionally bred mice affects cognition. Microbiota of mice housed in highly sanitized facilities has no effect on cognition."

Conventional antidepressants show limited efficacy in restoring cognitive function and may cause adverse effects. Green tea, a safe and health-promoting beverage, offers various health benefits. This study investigated the effects of long-term green tea consumption on stress-induced depression-like behavior and mild cognitive impairment in animal models. We established a rodent model of mild depression and studied the effects of green tea on depression-like behavior and cognitive impairment through comprehensive evaluation, including behavioral assessments, neurotransmitter quantification, gene and protein expression analysis, blood metabolite profiling, and gut microbiota characterization. Results demonstrated significant improvements in mood, long-term memory, and sterol and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Green tea repaired the intestinal barrier and upregulated genes vital for tight junctions and mucin production. It also enhanced gut microbiota composition, reducing the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio and promoting beneficial bacteria such as NK4A136, Muribaculum, and Gordonibacter. These microbiota changes improved liver lipid metabolism and alleviated depressive symptoms. Green tea effectively mitigates depression-like behavior and cognitive deficits by modulating the gut-liver-brain axis."

Patients underwent a battery of GI symptoms and QOL questionnaires and personalized actionable biomarkers (motility testing and swallowing studies). Inflammatory markers and stool tests were collected. An individualized standard of care treatment was established based on the specific DBGI diagnosis uncovered during the PRISM evaluation.Results44 adult PD patients with GI complaints were evaluated. The most common symptoms included constipation (97%), dysphagia (61%), and gastroesophageal reflux (34%). Actionable biomarkers were highly positive revealing esophageal dysmotility (20/21, 95%), slow-transit constipation (40/42, 90%), intestinal methanogen overgrowth (7/8, 87%), gastroparesis (17/20, 85%), oropharyngeal dysphagia (28/44, 63%), and dyssynergic defecation (27/42, 61%).

These symptoms impact the quality of life for persons living with Parkinson's disease, however, are often overlooked and may require specialized care. Recognizing the need for more comprehensive gastrointestinal care for persons with Parkinson's disease, clinicians at the Norman Fixel Institute for Neurologic Diseases developed the Parkinson's Research and Integrated Support Model (PRISM). PRISM is novel clinic which uses an interdisciplinary team of movement disorder experts, neurogastroenterologists, dietitians, occupational therapists, speech-swallow therapists, and neuroscientists to address complex gastrointestinal symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. The clinic is designed to be person-centric and to occur in a single visit. In this study, 44 persons with Parkinson's disease who were resistant to treatment of their GI dysfunction by a movement disorders neurologist were treated in the PRISM clinic between August 2021 and March 2024. This cohort experienced significant improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms including constipation, as well as overall quality of life, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary gastrointestinal care for persons with Parkinson's disease."

Its treatment includes rifaximin (RF), ciprofloxacin (CF), neomycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and metronidazole (MZ). RF is a non-absorbable antibiotic, postulated to have fewer adverse effects. Our aim was to assess symptomatic response and SIBO eradication in patients with IBS, using three antibiotic regimens.\nMETHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted on IBS patients over 18 years of age, utilizing the Rome IV questionnaire and lactulose breath test. Those diagnosed with SIBO were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic treatment. Group A was treated with RF, group B with CF, and group C with MZ, each for 10 days. Treatment response was evaluated based on the SIBO eradication rate 15 days after completing therapy, utilizing hydrogen and methane breath tests with lactulose. Self-reported symptoms were recorded on a 10-point Likert scale before, during, and after treatment.\nRESULTS: Ninety-seven patients with IBS and SIBO were included, 81% of whom completed treatment. Fifty-nine percent of the patients treated with RF achieved SIBO eradication, compared with 53% and 79% of those treated with CR and MZ, respectively. Metronidazole reduced more methane levels, compared with the other groups. However, the greatest reduction in abdominal pain and bloating was observed in the RF group, with a lower percentage of adverse events.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBS and SIBO benefit from antibiotic therapy. MZ exhibited the best SIBO eradication rate, but RF demonstrated greater symptomatic improvement and a lower rate of adverse effects."

In light of the brain's capability to reorganize itself in response to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, opioid-induced dysbiosis is likely to contribute to addictive behaviour through modulating neuroplasticity. In this study, a faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a saline-donor was performed on morphine-treated rats to evaluate the effects of gut microbiota on morphine-induced metaplasticity and addictive behaviours. Male Wistar rats were treated with subcutaneous injections of 10 mg/kg morphine sulphate every 12 h for 9 days in an effort to induce dependence. The withdrawal syndrome was precipitated by injecting naloxone (1.5 mg/kg, ip) after the final dose of morphine. The tolerance was induced by repeated morphine injections over a period of 7 days (10 mg/kg, once a day, ip). FMT was applied daily through gavage of processed faeces 1 week before and during the morphine treatment. Field potential recordings (i.e., fEPSP) were carried out to assess short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity in the CA1 area of the hippocampus following Schaffer-collateral stimulation. Animals subjected to FMT exhibited significant reductions in naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). Tolerance to the analgesic effects of morphine was not affected by FMT (two-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). Following high-frequency stimulation (HFS) to induce long-term potentiation (LTP), a greater fEPSP slope was observed in morphine-treated animals (unpaired t test, p < 0.05). FMT from saline-donor rats diminished morphine-induced augmented LTP (unpaired t test, p < 0.05). These results highlighted the alleviating effects of FMT from saline-donors on morphine-induced metaplasticity and dependence potentially by modulating the dysbiosis of gut microbiota."

Although antiseizure medications can control most seizures, up to 30% of patients experience uncontrolled seizures, leading to refractory epilepsy. Therefore, elucidating the pathogenesis of epilepsy and exploring new avenues to design antiepileptic drugs may improve epilepsy treatment. Recent studies have identified an imbalance of the gut microbiota (GM) in both patients with epilepsy and various animal models of epilepsy. In response to this phenomenon, an increasing number of studies have focused on controlling seizures by regulating GM homeostasis, utilizing methods such as dietary restrictions, fecal microbiota transplantation, and the use of prebiotics. Surprisingly, these interventions have shown promising antiepileptic effects, suggesting that GM, through the regulatory role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (gut-brain axis), may emerge as a novel strategy for treating epilepsy. This review aims to discuss the research progress on the relationship between GM and epilepsy, incorporating the latest clinical studies and animal experiments. We will specifically concentrate on the potential key role of the gut-brain axis in epileptogenesis, epilepsy development, and outcomes of epilepsy. Through a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms of the gut-brain axis, we aim to provide a more comprehensive perspective on understanding the pathophysiology of epilepsy and lay the groundwork for the development of new antiepileptic drugs in the future."

This review delves deeper into the connections of gut microbiota with PCOS pathophysiology, particularly into its impact on hormone metabolism, obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance by way of short-chain fatty acids, lipopolysaccharides, and gut-brain axis. Studies also show that changes in the metabolic processes and immune responses are seen in changes in the gut microbiota in PCOS subjects, such as changes in the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes groups. Some bacteria, like Escherichia and Shigella, have been associated with dysbiosis in patients with PCOS, leading to systemic inflammation and changed hormone levels, which further worsen the clinical symptoms. Therapeutic interventions targeting the gut microbiota comprise probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation; these have potential to alleviate the symptoms of PCOS. Other precision microbiome-based therapies include postbiotics, and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, which are relatively new avenues toward precision treatment. This complex interlink of gut microbiota and PCOS pathophysiology will open the avenues for possible treatments for hormonal imbalances and metabolic problems that characterize these complex disorders. The review here focuses on the requirement of further studies to be able to elucidate the specific pathways relating gut microbiota dysregulation to PCOS and, thus, improve microbiome-based therapies for better clinical outcomes in affected individuals."

Myopia progresses through childhood and adolescence, necessitating frequent prescription updates. While genetic and environmental factors are well-established contributors to myopia, emerging evidence suggests a significant role of the gut microbiota (GM) in its development, mainly through metabolic interactions. This study utilized a Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal relationships between GM, metabolites, and myopia and pathological myopia (PM) progression. Using genetic variants as instrumental variables, we analyzed data from extensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to assess the impacts of 473 GM taxa and 233 metabolites on myopia risks. Our MR analysis identified specific GM taxa and metabolites with significant causal relationship to myopia and PM. Notably, lipid metabolites were found to mediate the effects of GM on myopia, suggesting a biochemical pathway that could influence ocular development and myopia progression. We also observed significant mediation effects, indicating that specific metabolites might serve as therapeutic targets to modulate myopia progression. The findings highlight the potential of GM and metabolites as novel targets for preventing or managing myopia. This study underscores the importance of further research into the gut-metabolite-eye axis to develop targeted interventions for myopia based on modifying the GM through diet, probiotics, or other means. Future studies should aim to elucidate the specific metabolites involved and their roles in ocular health, potentially offering new avenues for treatment."

Recent evidence underscores the bidirectional communication between the microbiota, the gut, and the brain and the impact of this axis on neurological diseases, including epilepsy. In pediatric patients, alterations in gut microbiota composition-called intestinal dysbiosis-have been linked to seizure susceptibility. Preclinical models revealed that gut dysbiosis may exacerbate seizures, while microbiome-targeted therapies, including fecal microbiota transplantation, pre/pro-biotics, and ketogenic diets, show promise in reducing seizures. Focusing on clinical and preclinical studies, this review examines the role of the gut microbiota in pediatric epilepsy with the aim of exploring its implications for seizure control and management of epilepsy. We also discuss mechanisms that may underlie mutual gut-brain communication and emerging therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiome as a novel approach to improve outcomes in pediatric epilepsy. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Reciprocal communication between the brain and the gut appears to be dysfunctional in pediatric epilepsy. The composition of bacteria in the intestine -known as microbiota- and the gastrointestinal functions are altered in children with drug-resistant epilepsy and animal models of pediatric epilepsies. Microbiota-targeted interventions, such as ketogenic diets, pre-/post-biotics administration, and fecal microbiota transplantation, improve both gastrointestinal dysfunctions and seizures in pediatric epilepsy.

This review aims to elucidate the role of inflammation, gut microbiota, stress, and cognition, exploring their impact on the development of therapeutics to enhance oral health.\nOBJECTIVE: The primary aim pertinent to this systematic review is to elucidate the significant implications of cognition and stress in dental and orthodontic health. Specifically, the review aims to (1) investigate the association between emotional stress and the incidence or progression of periodontal disease; (2) explore the impact of physiological and emotional stress on cellular and molecular inflammatory responses in orthodontics; (3) examine the influence of gut-mediated psychophysiological factors on emotional changes in mental health and cognition with a focus on periodontics and orthodontics; and (4) investigate the potential of gut microbiota alterations to influence oral and cognitive/mental health, including the impact of probiotic supplementation and dietary interventions.\nMETHODS: A systematic review was conducted without comprehensive meta-analysis, focusing on literature from 1960 to 2024. Databases searched included PubMed, Embase, ReleMed, National Library of Medicine (NLM), Scopus, and Google Scholar. Keywords used were \"cognition,\" \"emotional stress,\" \"gut microbiota,\" \"orthodontics,\" \"prosthetics,\" \"pathophysiology,\" and \"mental health.\" Studies were selected based on relevance, publication date, access to full texts, and adherence to PRISMA guidelines. The review integrated findings on the impact of emotional stress on periodontal disease and orthodontic health through pathophysiological implications.\nRESULTS: Age-related neurodegeneration causes Alzheimer's disease and severe dementia that subsequently promotes poor oral health. The review identified a complex interplay between emotional stress and periodontal disease. While a direct association remains to be conclusively proven, several studies highlight the influence of stress on the severity and incidence of periodontal disease through inflammatory and immunological pathways. Stress manifests in various ways, such as increased masticatory muscle tone, changes in eating behavior, and the initiation of bruxism, all of which can affect dental health. Physiological stress induces an inflammatory response to orthodontic tooth movement, impacting orthodontic treatment outcomes. Furthermore, the review elucidates the role of gut-mediated psychophysiological factors in emotional changes, influencing periodontal and orthodontic health. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota alterations can significantly impact oral and cognitive health through systemic inflammation and neuroimmune mechanisms.\nCONCLUSION: This review highlights the significant impact of physiological and emotional stress on periodontal and orthodontic health. Detailed exploration of cellular and molecular inflammatory responses provides insights into the pathophysiology of orthodontic diseases and their impact on oral health. Gut-brain-oral axis has significance in oral health, exploring how alterations in gut microbiota influence oral and cognitive health. It is essential to investigate the impact of probiotic supplementation and dietary modifications on gut microbiota composition, systemic inflammation, and their influence on both cognitive and oral health. Clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatments in reducing periodontal disease and cognitive decline could offer valuable insights. Integrating advanced microbiome analysis techniques and neuroimaging can help clarify the mechanisms linking gut health, systemic inflammation, and cognitive function. Exploring specific gut microbiota strains that regulate systemic inflammation and cognitive function may lead to targeted probiotic therapies, potentially alleviating neuroinflammation and enhancing cognitive performance. Additionally, understanding the role of oral probiotics in periodontal health and their effects on gut microbiota and systemic inflammation could contribute to the development of innovative treatment approaches. This knowledge can aid molecular biologists, dentists, and researchers in managing oral and gut health more effectively."

Utilizing genetic data from the OpenGWAS and Finngen databases, we applied various MR methods, including Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), IVW-multiplicative random effects (MRE), weighted median (WM), MR-Egger, and robust adjusted profile score (RAPS), to investigate these associations. The analysis revealed no significant causal relationship between CeD and several other neurological disorders, but a significant positive association with MS was found (IVW OR=1.1919, 95% CI: 1.0851~1.3092, p=0.0002). Further analysis indicated that the mediator CCL19 plays a significant role in the pathway from CeD to MS, suggesting that CCL19 may be a key factor in the immune response linking these conditions. This mediation effect highlights the potential mechanism through which CeD increases the risk of developing MS. These findings emphasize the complexity of the relationship between CeD and MS, indicating the need for further research to understand these connections better and their clinical implications."

This review consolidates evidence on AE's role in alleviating the physiological and psychological effects of these comorbid conditions. It delves into the pathophysiological connections between T2DM and various MD, including depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, and bipolar disorder-emphasizing their reciprocal exacerbation. Key neurophysiological mechanisms through which AE confers benefits are explored, including neuroinflammation modulation, brain structure and neuroplasticity enhancement, growth factor expression regulation, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)/microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis normalization. Clinical results indicate that AE significantly improves both metabolic and psychological parameters in patients with T2DM and MD, providing a substantial argument for integrating AE into comprehensive treatment plans. Future research should aim to establish detailed, personalized exercise prescriptions and explore the long-term benefits of AE in this population.

Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is a receptor for ghrelin, which is expressed in the brain, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands, especially in the hypothalamus. The binding of ghrelin to the receptor 1a subtype mediates most of the biological effects of ghrelin. Ghrelin has a close relationship with the onset of psychosis. Ghrelin can affect the onset of psychosis by regulating neurotransmitters such as dopamine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, brain-gut axis, the mesolimbic dopamine system, and other ways. Ghrelin activates neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) through the GHSR. Ghrelin binds to neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), where it promotes the activity of dopamine neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAcs) in a GHSR-dependent way, increasing dopamine levels and the reward system.

Valproic acid (VPA), a commonly used antiepileptic drug, has been shown to induce ASD-like behaviors in rodent models, making it a valuable tool for studying the pathophysiology of ASD. This study aims to explore the effects of VPA on behavior and the microbiota in a mouse model of ASD.\nMETHODS: C57BL/6 mice were used in this study, with pregnant females receiving a single intraperitoneal injection of VPA (450 mg/kg) or a saline solution on gestational day E12.5. Behavioral assessments, including the Three-Chamber Social Test, Elevated Plus Maze, Marble Burying Test, Open Field Test, and Light-Dark Box Test, were conducted on 8-week-old mice. Oral and fecal samples were collected for microbiota analysis, and gene expression profiling was performed on brain samples.\nRESULTS: VPA-treated mice exhibited significant deficits in social interaction, anxiety-like behaviors, and repetitive actions. Microbiota analysis revealed significant shifts in the composition of both oral and fecal microbial communities in VPA-treated mice, with reductions in alpha diversity and changes in the relative abundance of specific taxa. Gene set variation analysis of mice harboring VPA-induced microbiota identified notable discrepancies in metabolic pathways, suggesting that the dysbiosis may modulate the expression of genes involved in critical metabolic processes.\nCONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that VPA exposure during early development can induce ASD-like behaviors in mice, along with significant changes in the composition of the microbiota. These findings underscore the complex interplay between environmental factors, such as VPA, and the microbiota in the pathophysiology of ASD. The study lays the groundwork for future research aimed at developing targeted interventions to mitigate the symptoms of ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders, potentially through modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis."

The mice underwent a standard CDI protocol (VPI10463) and were treated, or not, with vancomycin. Disease severity was tracked for 14 d, then novel object recognition (NOR) tests for acute memory were performed. Hippocampal tissues were assayed for molecular markers.\nRESULTS: NOR testing confirmed CDI-induced cognitive impairment (P = 0.0352). AQ pretreatment had mild neuroprotective effects during CDI. Mice treated with vancomycin and continuous AQ had better clinical scores and better memory performance than vancomycin controls (P = 0.0286). Continuous AQ treatment, when used alone or paired with vancomycin, offered protection against CDI-induced cognitive impairment. The mechanism of CDI-induced memory impairment remains unclear, but infected mice had elevated synaptobrevin-2 (P = 0.0396) and neural cell adhesion molecule (P = 0.008) compared with uninfected controls on day 14 post infection.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that neuroinflammation and memory loss occur during CDI, which may be ameliorated by AQ supplementation.

The results showed that body weight, mobility, and spatial memory capacity of aging mice were restored after LF (M & H) intervention.

LF (M & H) increased brain and serum levels of antioxidant defense enzymes (SOD, GSH, CAT) and decreased colon and serum levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α). Western blotting results showed that LF (M & H) increased LC3II/I, Beclin1 expression, decreased p-mTOR, p-akt, and p62 expression, and restored autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/m-TOR pathway. Furthermore, LF (M & H) protected the intestinal barrier by regulating the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and increased levels of the beneficial metabolites short chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

Probiotic supplements have shown beneficial effects on cognition and mood in clinical populations, but the potential benefit for healthy older adults experiencing age-related decline in cognition remains unclear.\nOBJECTIVES: The primary aim of the present work was to explore the effect of a chronic (long-term) multispecies probiotic intervention on cognition in healthy aging adults. Secondary aims included exploring the chronic effect on mood outcomes and gut microbiota community, as well as a novel investigation into the acute effect of supplementation on cognition and mood.\nMETHODS: The study employed a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in 30 healthy older adults to explore the acute (1 d) and chronic (8 wk) effects of a probiotic supplement on cognitive domains of memory and executive function, alongside mood measures of stress, anxiety, depression, and cognitive reactivity to sad mood. 16s rRNA sequencing of stool samples was also performed pre- and postchronic intervention to assess potential effects on the gut microbiota.\nRESULTS: Acute probiotic supplementation was associated with faster reaction times on cognitively demanding trials during a task of executive function [-64.91 ms, 95% confidence interval (CI): -115.70, -14.15]. Chronic supplementation was associated with improvement in cognitive biases such as hopelessness (-0.97, 95% CI: -1.72, -0.23), rumination (-1.58, 95% CI: -2.86, -0.29), and aggression (-1.57, 95% CI: -2.63, -0.51) that contribute to reactivity to sad mood and therefore vulnerability to depression, and may improve executive function under higher cognitive demand (0.43%, 95% CI: -0.53%, 1.38%).\nCONCLUSIONS: The current work provides novel evidence for an acute effect of probiotics on reaction times during executive function, which should be replicated in future work. Additionally, this work replicates previous findings of improved cognitive reactivity to sad mood following chronic probiotic supplementation, indicating probiotics may reduce risk of developing depression in a healthy aging population.

Extensive research has indicated positive effects of 2'-FL on cognitive development in the brain, yet its molecular mechanisms have remained elusive. This study aimed to assess the impact of 2'-FL on the gut-brain axis microbiota and cognitive function in growing mice, along with its potential mechanisms of action.\nRESULTS: Following long-term supplementation for 4 weeks, 2'-FL was found to enhance cognitive memory function in growing mice (3 weeks old) as assessed through Y-maze, novel object recognition, and water maze tests. Analysis via 16S rRNA sequencing revealed significant alterations in gut microbiota diversity and composition induced by 2'-FL, notably increasing the relative abundance of Bacteroides and Lactobacillus genera. Additionally, 2'-FL significantly elevated levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in the hippocampal tissue. However, antibiotic intervention abolished the cognitive advantage conferred by 2'-FL, highlighting the critical role of gut microbiota in mediating its effects. Similarly, short-term supplementation with 2'-FL for 7 days indicated rapid changes in gut microbiota composition preceding cognitive improvements, further suggesting a potential causal relationship between gut microbiota characteristics and cognition. Further, in vitro experiments with mouse feces suggested that 2'-FL may influence tryptophan hydroxylase levels in the gut microbiota and inhibit the activity of 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase, potentially leading to increased accumulation of 5-HTP. Additionally, 2'-FL may indirectly impact tryptophan hydroxylase levels in enterochromaffin cells by promoting short-chain fatty acid production, which could support 5-HTP synthesis. Elevated 5-HTP produced by the gut system enters the bloodstream, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and may potentially enhance brain 5-HT levels.\nCONCLUSION: This study offers preliminary evidence that the cognitive-promoting effects of 2'-FL in mice may be closely associated with gut microbiota and 5-HT. The findings suggest that 2'-FL contribute to cognitive development in growing mice, potentially by modulating gut microbiota and enhancing 5-HT levels in the brain. Video Abstract."

It elevated the abundance of anti-inflammatory gut bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Dubosiella, Akkermansia) and reversed 55 fecal metabolites linked to sphingolipid metabolism, serotonergic synapses, and neuroactive ligand- receptor interactions. Spatial metabolomics revealed WFA's regulation of sphingolipid signaling pathways, including sphingosine kinase (Sphk1), ceramidase, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR5), and endocannabinoid receptor CB2 expression.

Malnutrition, affecting nearly half of CKD patients, exacerbates cognitive decline through inflammation, oxidative stress and protein-energy wasting. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly in protein, vitamin D, B vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, are linked to impaired cognition. Emerging evidence highlights the role of the gut-brain axis, with gut-derived uraemic toxins and microbiome alterations contributing to cognitive dysfunction. Processed foods and microplastics further compound risks by promoting inflammation and neurotoxicity. Dialysis and kidney transplantation offer opportunities for cognitive recovery, though challenges remain, particularly in haemodialysis patients. Nutritional interventions, including tailored protein intake, micronutrient supplementation and dietary counselling, are critical for mitigating cognitive decline. Addressing CKD comorbidities, such as anaemia and diabetes through targeted nutritional and pharmacological strategies, improves outcomes. Integrating psychological and social support enhances quality of life, given the high prevalence of anxiety and depression in CKD patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Future research should focus on personalized nutrition, gut microbiota modulation and routine cognitive assessments to optimise care. A holistic approach combining medical, nutritional and psychosocial strategies is essential for improving cognitive and overall health in CKD patients."

        "abstract": "Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment, particularly during pregnancy and early childhood. It is essential for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and nervous system function. Maternal B12 levels are particularly important, as they influence fetal brain development. Inadequate maternal intake during pregnancy may lead to altered neurodevelopmental trajectories and increase the risk of ASD. Postnatally, insufficient dietary cobalamin in infants and young children could further contribute to cognitive and behavioral impairments. One potential mechanism linking low B12 levels to ASD involves its role in the gut microbiota balance. Dysbiosis, commonly observed in individuals with ASD, is associated with increased gut permeability, low-grade inflammation, and disruptions in the gut-brain axis, all of which may contribute to ASD symptoms. Additionally, B12 is essential for neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of serotonin and dopamine, which regulate mood, cognition, and behavior. Cobalamin also plays a key role in neuronal myelination, which ensures efficient signal transmission in the nervous system. Disruptions in these processes could underlie some of the cognitive and behavioral features associated with ASD. Despite growing evidence, the link between B12 and ASD remains inconclusive due to inconsistent findings across studies. Research suggests that B12 levels may serve as a potential biomarker for disease progression and treatment response. However, many studies rely on single-time-point measurements, failing to account for individual variability, genetic predispositions, dietary intake, and environmental factors, all of which can influence B12 levels and ASD risk. Further longitudinal studies are needed to clarify this relationship."

        "abstract": "A body of evidence indicates an association between ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) and health outcomes. Most of it has been obtained through preclinical studies, although a number of observational studies substantiate how a high intake of these products increases the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders, and an increasing amount of dietary intervention studies confirm these findings. The aim of this narrative review is to describe some of the putative mechanisms involved in the deleterious effects of a high intake of UPFs on neuropsychiatric outcomes. A myriad of unhealthy actions may be associated with the consumption of UPFs, and some mechanisms are being discussed. They include UPFs' high caloric density; their high sugar, sodium, and additives content and low amounts of fiber; and a high palatability that induces overconsumption, acting as obesogens. Moreover, thermal treatment of these foods generates oxidative products such as glycotoxins, lipotoxins, and acrolein, all of which affect the brain. The chemical products act, directly or indirectly, on the gut microbiome and affect the gut-brain axis, causing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. UPFs also exert various epigenetic effects that affect mental health and might explain the intergenerational inheritance of neuropsychiatric disorders. A diet containing a high proportion of these foods has a low nutritional density, including bioactive protective agents such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds that promote eubiosis. The evidence shows that UPFs intake affects neuropsychiatric outcomes such as neurodegeneration, cognitive decline, dementia, and mood disorders and reinforces the need to promote a healthy dietary pattern throughout all life stages, thus interfering with the current commercial determinants of health."

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of complex neurodevelopmental conditions with a heterogeneous and multifactorial etiology that is not yet fully understood. Among the various factors that may contribute to ASD development, alterations in the gut microbiota have been increasingly recognized. Microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract play a crucial role in the gut-brain axis (GBA), affecting nervous system development and behavior. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the microbiota, has been linked to both behavioral and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in individuals with ASD. The microbiota interacts with the central nervous system through mechanisms such as the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the regulation of neurotransmitters, and immune system modulation. Alterations in its composition, including reduced diversity or an overabundance of specific bacterial taxa, have been associated with the severity of ASD symptoms. Dietary modifications, such as gluten-free or antioxidant-rich diets, have shown potential for improving gut health and alleviating behavioral symptoms. Probiotics, with their anti-inflammatory properties, may support neural health and reduce neuroinflammation. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is being considered, particularly for individuals with persistent GI symptoms. It has shown promising outcomes in enhancing microbial diversity and mitigating GI and behavioral symptoms. However, its limitations should be considered, as discussed in this narrative review. Further research is essential to better understand the long-term effects and safety of these therapies. Emphasizing the importance of patient stratification and phenotype characterization is crucial for developing personalized treatment strategies that account for individual microbiota profiles, genetic predispositions, and coexisting conditions. This approach could lead to more effective interventions for individuals with ASD. Recent findings suggest that gut microbiota may play a key role in innovative therapeutic approaches to ASD management."

All tested concentrations led to upregulation of the serotonin transporter (slc6a4a). At intermediate concentrations, overexpression of the serotonin receptor htr1aa was observed. The highest concentration caused a reduced total enteric neurons density, while the intermediate concentration reduced the density of serotonergic enteric neurons. Additionally, the highest concentration decreased larval locomotion and impaired their ability to differentiate between light and dark phases.Across all tested concentrations, fluoxetine disrupted serotonergic signaling, impaired enteric neurogenesis, and induced sedative-like behavioral effects."

We previously demonstrated that childhood social isolation (SI) stress affects colonic function, leading to cognitive impairment. Cellulose, an insoluble dietary fiber, shows benefits to intestinal health, but its potential impact on cognitive impairment has not been explored.\nOBJECTIVES: This study investigated whether a high-cellulose diet ameliorates cognitive impairment induced by SI through modulation of gut microbiota and metabolic pathways.\nMETHODS: C57BL/6J male mice (3 wk old; n = 10-15/group) were randomly divided into 2 groups: individually housed (SI) group and housed 5 mice per cage (group-housed) group. Each group received either a normal diet (5% cellulose) or a high-cellulose diet (30% cellulose) for 5 wk daily until the end of the behavioral testing. We evaluated behavior abnormalities, gut microbiota composition, and metabolites, and performed 2-way analysis of variance.\nRESULTS: Intake of a high-cellulose diet ameliorated cognitive impairment, including decreased time spent in a novel location of SI mice in novel object location test (NOLT; +30%; P < 0.01) with reduction of Iba-1 positive cells, microglia, in the hippocampus (-33%; P < 0.05). The high-cellulose diet indicated a significant difference in gut microbiota clustering plots (P < 0.01) and enhanced the variation in malate-aspartate shuttle pathways in SI mice (P < 0.01). Notably, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from SI mice fed a high-cellulose diet after antibiotic treatment, replicated amelioration of cognitive impairment in NOLT (+46%; P < 0.01). Additionally, the FMT replicated a decrease of Iba-1 positive cells indicating suppressed hippocampal microglial activation (-52%; P < 0.01), and enhanced the variation in malate-aspartate shuttle pathways (P < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a high-cellulose diet may ameliorate pediatric-specific cognitive impairment through modulation of the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways."

The GBA is a complex, bidirectional communication network that integrates the gastrointestinal tract, the central nervous system, and the gut microbiota. This axis is mediated through various physiological pathways, including the enteric nervous system (ENS), the vagus nerve, immune responses, and metabolic activities of gut microorganisms. ASD, a developmental disorder marked by social impairments and repetitive behaviors, presents with notable neurological irregularities. The review highlights the increased prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances in individuals with ASD, suggesting a potential link between GI symptoms and the severity of ASD-related behaviors. This correlation is supported by evidence of altered gut microbiota composition in ASD, indicating significant interactions between the gut environment and neurological health. Moreover, the pathophysiology of ASD is explored with an emphasis on genetic and environmental contributions to neurodevelopmental impairments. Key topics include synaptic dysfunction, the roles of neurotransmitters like GABA and serotonin, and the impact of gut-brain interactions on ASD progression. Specifically, this review addresses how gut microbiota may influence metabolic alterations, immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and neurotransmitter production in ASD. Emerging research on microbiome-based therapies for ASD is discussed, focusing on the potential of probiotics, prebiotics, and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as novel interventions. Ethical considerations in this burgeoning field are also considered, highlighting the necessity for rigorous scientific inquiry and ethical oversight. The review advocates for a multidisciplinary approach to understanding and addressing the complexities of ASD. By integrating insights from genetics, neuroscience, psychology, and gastroenterology, a more comprehensive understanding of the role of GBA in ASD can be achieved. This interdisciplinary perspective is crucial for developing effective, individualized treatments and improving the quality of life for individuals with ASD."

Here, a potential role for dopaminergic signaling is considered. This review first examines evidence that dopamine is important to neuroplasticity after stroke. Next, 2 different dopaminergic pathways are considered potential mechanisms underlying vagus nerve stimulation-related benefits after stroke, direct modulation of brain dopaminergic pathways, and engagement of systemic dopaminergic pathways such as those found in the gut-brain axis.

This study explores how electroacupuncture (EA) influences the PI3K/Akt pathway and its role in regulating the gut-brain axis, focusing on whether EA can modulate this axis via the PI3K/Akt pathway in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The research aims to reveal the mechanisms underlying EA's therapeutic effects and to investigate a novel strategy for managing T2DM.\nMETHODS: To induce T2DM in rat models, a high-fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) were used. The rats were then randomly divided into four groups: a T2DM group, an EA group, an EA plus PI3K inhibitor group (EA + LY294002), and a control group (Con), which received a standard diet and a citric acid-sodium citrate solution. Following five weeks of intervention, assessments were conducted for food intake, body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood lipid profiles, and insulin resistance (IR). To analyze the PI3K/Akt pathway and gut-brain axis indices, various methods were employed, including Western blotting, qPCR, immunohistochemistry staining, HE staining, and 16 S rRNA sequencing.\nRESULTS: Our research shows that EA improves food intake, body weight, FBG, lipid levels (TC, TG, HDL, LDL), serum insulin levels, IR and insulin sensitivity indices in T2DM rats. Additionally, EA boosts the expression of colonic tight junction proteins ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 while reducing intestinal inflammation and intestinal cell apoptosis. It also regulates Ghrelin and PYY levels in both colonic and hypothalamic tissues, improving the gut microbiota structure. These effects can be reversed by PI3K inhibitors.\nCONCLUSIONS: EA plays a role in managing feeding behavior, body weight, and glucolipid metabolism, as well as alleviating IR in T2DM rats. EA may contribute to the preservation of intestinal mucosal barrier integrity, likely through anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. Additionally, EA appears to influence the regulation of brain-gut peptides and promote a healthier gut microbiota composition. These findings suggest that EA holds potential as an therapeutic approach for T2DM, with its mechanisms potentially linked to the modulation of the gut-brain axis via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate these effects and their clinical implications."

In this study, we examined the fecal microbiota and inflammatory profiles of 99 depressed adolescents and 106 age-matched healthy controls using Illumina NovaSeq sequencing and multiplex immunoassays, respectively. Our findings revealed lower bacterial α-diversity and richness, alongside altered β-diversity in adolescents with depression. Gut dysbiosis associated with adolescent depression was characterized by increased pro-inflammatory genera such as Streptococcus and decreased anti-inflammatory genera like Faecalibacterium. These differential genera may serve as potential non-invasive biomarkers for adolescent depression, either individually or in combination. We also observed disruptions in the inferred microbiota functions in adolescent depression-associated microbiota, particularly in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Additionally, depressed adolescents exhibited systemic immune dysfunction, with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which showed significant correlations with the differential genera. Our study bridges the gap between children and adults by providing new insights into the fecal microbiota characteristics and their links to immune system disruptions in depressed adolescents, which offer new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of depression in this age group."

Indeed, GM, a community of microorganisms residing in the gut, has emerged as a potential player in various diseases, and several studies have identified associations between sleep apnea and GM diversity along with shifts in bacterial populations. Additionally, the concept of \"leaky gut,\" a compromised intestinal barrier with potentially increased inflammation, has emerged as another key player in the potential bidirectional relationship between GM and sleep apnea.

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a common chronic neuropsychiatric disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1% in children and adolescents. TS is characterized by sudden involuntary motor tics along with vocal tics. A pathological study on postmortem patients has reported a 50-60% reduction in striatal gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons, suggesting a role for GABAergic system imbalances in tic disorder development. However, the effect of exogenous GABA administration on tic alleviation remains unreported.\nOBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to investigate the therapeutic effects of exogenous GABA on TS-like behaviors in Sprague-Dawley rats and explore its potential mechanisms, including gut microbiota regulation, oxidative stress mitigation, and restoration of GABA-glutamate balance, to provide insights into TS pathogenesis and alternative treatment strategies.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A TS model rat was established through intraperitoneal administration of 3,3-Iminodipropionitrile (150 mg/kg/day), followed by GABA (20 mg/kg/day) administration by gavage. 15 minutes of behavioral testing (stereotypical behavior and head twitching behavior) was then conducted. 16S rRNA sequencing identified microbiome changes, and LC-MS assessed striatal metabolite changes.\nRESULTS: The results showed that a 4-week GABA treatment alleviated TS-like behavior in rats. GABA treatment led to an increase in Acinetobacter and other beneficial bacteria. GABA also significantly upregulated 15 striatal metabolites compared with TS group. By correlation analysis of striatal metabolites and intestinal bacteria, statistical analysis showed that Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 was negatively correlated with metabolites on the top 20 differential gut microbiota and metabolites. Moreover, changes in gut microbiota correlated with alterations in striatal metabolites, suggesting a gut-brain axis involvement.\nCONCLUSION: Exogenous GABA alleviated TS-like behavior in rats by reducing harmful gut flora and modulating striatal GABA-glutamate metabolism. Despite challenges like low blood-brain barrier permeability and dose safety in humans, GABA's therapeutic potential may be realized through prodrug development and optimized dosing. These findings are preliminary and require further clinical validation."

Clinical questionnaires and non-invasive measurement of heart rate variability may be useful in patients with GERD to detect autonomic dysfunction. Restoration of parasympathetic system activity (mainly neuromodulation), with subsequent improvement of parasympathetic activity, will reduce the intensity of autonomic symptoms and GERD, improving quality of life.\nLa enfermedad por reflujo gastroesofágico (ERGE) es una condición compleja y altamente prevalente. El deterioro de la comunicación intestino-cerebro está asociado a la disfunción autonómica. La modulación del sistema nervioso autónomo controla las funciones gastrointestinales.

        "abstract": "Neuroangiostrongyliasis is characterized by eosinophilic meningoencephalitis with a robust onset of severe neurological symptoms, by which immunological factors and peripheral metabolites have been postulated to affect the course of the disease. The gut-brain axis provides a bidirectional communication between the gut and the central nervous system, and therefore, understanding the gut microbiome may provide us with a deeper insight into the pathogenesis of angiostrongyliasis. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we identified an increase in the abundance of different Lactobacillus species in Angiostrongylus cantonensis-infected mice, which was correlated to the disease severity. However, attempts to inoculate L. johnsonii into A. cantonensis-infected mice surprisingly revealed an improvement in neuroinflammation and prolonged survival. RNA sequencing suggested an immune-modulatory effect of L. johnsonii, which was confirmed by ELISA, showing increased levels of IL-10 and reduced levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and MCP-1 in the brain. Nevertheless, L. johnsonii-associated improvements were not associated with microbiome-related metabolites, as UHPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed no change in short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bile acids. Our results suggest that while intestinal L. johnsonii appears to be linked to the progression of neuroangiostrongyliasis, these bacteria are likely attempting to modulate the dysregulated immune response to combat the disease. This is one of the first studies to investigate the gut microbiome in mice with A. cantonensis infection, which extends our knowledge from the microbiome-point-of-view of the pathogenesis of angiostrongyliasis and how the body defends against A. cantonensis. This work also extends to possible treatment approaches using L. johnsonii as probiotics."

Patients were required to have a negative glucose breath test, prior to lactose and fructose breath tests, and to have completed the adult carbohydrate perception questionnaire (aCPQ) during each breath test. Intolerance was defined as an increase of ≥20 mm in the visual analog scale (VAS) score from baseline in at least one of the 5 symptoms (pain, nausea, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea) assessed with the aCPQ.\nRESULTS: Among the 301 DGBI patients included in our analysis, 178 (59.1%) had carbohydrate intolerance. Carbohydrate-intolerant patients were significantly more likely to be female (p-value < 0.001), to have 2 or more DGBI (p-value= 0.001), to have lactose maldigestion (p-value< 0.001) and fructose malabsorption (p-value= 0.023), higher IBS and somatic symptom severity, and lower quality of life (p-value < 0.001) compared to patients without carbohydrate intolerance. The binary logistic regression showed that lactose maldigestion (p-value= 0.001), as well as somatic symptoms (p-value= 0.025), were independently associated with carbohydrate intolerance (Nagelkerke R Square= 0.206).\nDISCUSSION: Carbohydrate intolerance affects a substantial group of DGBI patients, impacting their quality of life and symptom severity. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms in patients who do not have carbohydrate malabsorption/maldigestion."

Our aim was to assess the prevalence of DGBI among obese subjects in the general population in comparison with normal or overweight subjects, as well as exploring factors associated with DGBI in obesity in Europe.\nMETHODS: We included subjects who completed the internet-based survey of the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology study in 11 European countries. Obesity was defined as a BMI>30 kg/m\nRESULTS: We included 20,117 participants in our analysis. The prevalence of obesity was 17.8% (95% CI 17.3, 18.4), with 12.6%, 3.7% and 1.6% in obesity classes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The prevalence of any DGBI was 44.2% in the obese group versus 39.6% in the normal or overweight group (OR = 1.20 (1.12, 1.30)), with all DGBI being more prevalent in the obese versus normal or overweight group, with the exception for functional constipation where the opposite pattern was seen. Female sex, higher level of psychological distress and more severe non-GI somatic symptoms were seen in the group with DGBI associated with obesity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Symptoms compatible with DGBI are common among European people with obesity in the general population and are linked with certain demographic and disease-related factors.

While our previous work demonstrated heterophyllin B (HB) rectifies splenic Th1/Th2 imbalance and ameliorates cognitive deficits in Aβ1-42-induced AD mice, its potential modulation of the vagus nerve-spleen circuit remains unexplored.\nMETHODS: Using 8-month-old male APP/PS1 mice with/without splenic denervation (SD), we systematically investigated HB's therapeutic mechanisms via the spleen-gut microbiota-brain axis. Cognitive function was assessed through novel object recognition (ORT) and object location memory (OLT) tests. Immunofluorescence (IF) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were employed to analyze Aβ plaques, phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) levels, and associated neuroinflammatory responses. Flow cytometry was utilized to examine the subtypes of splenic lymphocytes. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, along with immunohistochemical (IHC) experiments, was conducted to evaluate the protective effects of HB on the intestinal barrier. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing.\nRESULTS: HB administration significantly improved cognitive performance (ORT discrimination index: +28.7 %; OLT discrimination index: +26.6 %), reduced brain and serum Aβ1-42 and p-Tau levels, downregulated the Th1/Th2 ratio in the spleen, and alleviated intestinal permeability and neuroinflammation, which were abolished in SD APP/PS1 mice. Gut microbiota shifts showed HB-induced enrichment of cognition-associated Dubosiella and Muribaculaceae, with concurrent suppression of pathogenic Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 and ASF356.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides first evidence that HB ameliorates AD pathology through vagus nerve-dependent regulation of the spleen-gut microbiota-brain axis, establishing its multimodal therapeutic potential for neural-immune-gut circuit modulation in neurodegenerative diseases."

Our findings revealed that perinatal PS-NPs exposure elicited depression-like behaviors, diminished social dominance, and reduced social interactions in adult offspring. Additionally, we observed a decrease in dendritic spine density within hippocampal neurons, along with ultrastructural damage to hippocampal neurons and synapses in the adult offspring. PS-NPs exposure also led to a reduction in the richness and evenness of gut microbiota species composition in both male and female mice, with gut dysbiosis being particularly pronounced in adult males. Furthermore, alterations in metabolite abundance and metabolic pathways were detected in the hippocampus of both male and female adult offspring. Notably, a significant correlation was identified between the relative abundance of intestinal microorganisms and hippocampal metabolites.

However, no studies have delineated the interaction of gut microbiota with gut-originated PD. We established a gut-originated PD murine model and subsequently characterized changes in gut microbiota over an eight-month period. Progressive motor dysfunction, decreased dopaminergic neurons and spreading of α-syn pathology was observed at several time points during the 8-month disease progression, along with changes in the composition of the gut microbiota. Increases in Dubosiella at genus level occurred from 4 months, and was highly consistent with the time point of disease progression. Metabolic function prediction of gut microbiota suggested metabolic disorders of branched-chain-amino acids (BCAA), which resulted in accumulation of BCAA in peripheral blood. Removal of gut microbiota by antibiotic treatment reversed the progression of PD, as well as decreased the levels of Dubosiella and BCAA. Remarkably, Dubosiella newyorkensis disrupted the BCAA metabolism and mediated the accumulation of BCAA in mouse colon organoids. Consistent with the results observed in the animal model, abnormally elevated serum BCAA were also detected in the PD patients enrolled in this study. Furthermore, excessive BCAA caused lysosome dysfunction in microglia, suggesting that accumulated BCAA mediated by the gut microbiota may be an important mechanism in preventing the degradation of α-syn. These results show that microbiota-dependent BCAA function to inhibit α-syn degradation, thus enhancing PD progression, and provides compelling evidence for microbiota intervention therapy for PD.

We aimed to determine how vitamin C supplementation improves mental vitality through the gut microbiome and associated neurological and immunological changes. We used 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze gut microbiota profiles of participants from our previous trial, in which healthy young adults (20-39 years) with inadequate serum vitamin C levels (< 50 μM) received 500 mg vitamin C or a placebo twice daily for 4 weeks (vitamin C, n = 21; placebo, n = 19). We examined whether changes in gut microbiota correlated with previously determined mental vitality indices, including Stroop test performance, work engagement, and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Serum concentrations of microbial-derived molecules, cytokines, and neurotransmitters were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay, or ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Monocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood were quantified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Vitamin C supplementation increased the relative abundance of Bacillaceae and Anaerotruncus, while decreasing Desulfovibrio, with the Desulfovibrio reduction correlating with Stroop test performance. Moreover, participants showing a substantial Desulfovibrio reduction (\"responders\") demonstrated greater BDNF increases and stronger correlations between serum L-DOPA levels and work engagement scores than did non-responders. In addition, vitamin C supplementation suppressed inflammatory responses with concurrent reduction in serum lipopolysaccharide levels, and responders showed greater decreases in IL-10 levels and classical monocyte frequencies than non-responders. In conclusion, vitamin C supplementation modulates gut microbiota composition, particularly by reducing Desulfovibrio abundance, with the extent of reduction correlating with mental vitality improvements and decreased inflammation. This study provides insights into vitamin C supplementation as a critical dietary intervention, as it may modulate mental health through its influence on the gut-brain-immune axis."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antibacterials are among the most frequently prescribed medications. Antibacterial drugs have the unintended consequence of destroying healthy gut flora, which can lead to known adverse events such as Clostridium difficile infection. Given emerging research concerning the role of these microorganisms in the gut-brain axis and some limited epidemiological studies, the objective of this study was to determine if antimicrobial exposure is associated with increased risk for depression.\nMETHODS: National Veterans Health Administration administrative data were used to identify 878,405 veteran patients prescribed an incident antimicrobial during calendar year 2018. Sequence symmetry analysis was used to compare the incidence of a depressive disorder in the 6 months before and after antibacterial exposure, with additional analyses conducted with other antimicrobial classes as negative controls including antifungals, antivirals, and nonsystemic antibacterials.\nRESULTS: Antibacterial initiation was associated with a small but significant increase in the risk of incident depression (symmetry ratio [SR] = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 1.05), which was limited to the first 8 weeks following exposure. The strength of association varied with categories of antibacterial spectrum, from SR = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.01) with the narrowest spectrum regimens, to SR = 1.12 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.15) with the broadest regimens. No significant association with incident depression was observed for antifungals, antivirals, and nonsystemic antibacterials.\nCONCLUSIONS: Antibacterial exposure was associated with increased risk for a depressive disorder. These findings are consistent with emerging literature and support the need for further research investigating a causal relationship between antibacterial exposure and risk for adverse mental health outcomes."

Alcohol, a modifiable risk factor for noncommunicable diseases, resulted in approximately 3 million global deaths (5 %) in 2016 according to the World Health Organization.\nAIMS: A narrative synthesis examines the effects of alcohol and faecal microbiota transplantation on gut microbiota and how gut microbiota impacts the gut-brain axis, leading to certain behavioural symptoms of alcohol use disorder. These behavioural symptoms are alcohol craving and relapse in humans; and preference for alcohol, anxiety and depression in rodents.\nSEARCH METHODS AND RESULTS: Electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched in January 2024 using the terms: faecal microbiota trans* AND alcohol AND microbio*. Ten studies out of 964 met the inclusion criteria of published primary studies with faecal microbiota transplantation as an intervention to study the gut-brain axis in alcohol use disorder.\nRESULTS: The gut microbiota is altered in alcohol use disorder, which can be modified with faecal microbiota transplantation. Behavioural symptoms such as alcohol craving and relapse are associated with inflammation due to a loss of intestinal barrier function. Beneficial microbiota produce short-chain fatty acids that maintain intestinal barrier function and reduce inflammation. Studies also reported anxiety and depression-like behaviours, in addition to a preference for alcohol in alcohol-naïve rodents after faecal microbiota transplantation from patients with alcohol use disorder.\nCONCLUSIONS: Faecal microbiota transplantation may moderate the behavioural symptoms of alcohol use disorder by altering gut microbiota, affecting intestinal permeability and inflammation, however, specific gut microbiota composition and long-term treatment outcomes require further clinical studies."

The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in the occurrence, development, and recurrence of glioma. As one of the important regulatory factors of TME, the gut microbiota can regulate the progression of glioma not only by interacting with the brain through the brain-gut axis but also by influencing the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and inflammatory microenvironment. Recent studies have identified the gut microbiota and TME as potential therapeutic targets for glioma. This paper aims to summarize the role of the gut microbiota in TME, the association between them and glioma, and the potential of developing new intervention measures by targeting the gut microbiota. Understanding the involvement process of the gut microbiota in glioma may pave the way for the development of effective treatment methods that can regulate TME and prevent disease progression."

However, its mechanism of action in treating IBS patients with depressive symptoms is still unclear.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the effects of XYS on intestinal and depressive symptoms in IBS and explore the mechanisms through transcriptomic analysis and pharmacological experiments.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: IBS was induced in mice through a combination of chronic unpredictable mild stress and intragastric senna leaf stimulation. We evaluated six depressive parameters, examined colon tissue with hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy, analyzed related proteins using western blotting, and performed transcriptomics on brain and intestinal tissues. The possible mechanism of action was speculated by network analysis of transcriptome results and further verified using the IBS model.\nRESULTS: The results show that XYS restored mouse weight, reduced intestinal symptoms and sensitivity, suppressed villous loss and atrophy, and enhanced the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Notably, XYS decreased the depression-like behavior. Transcriptomic analysis combined with pharmacological experiments revealed that XYS inhibited the expression of proteins related to the intestinal ACT1/TRAF6/P38MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathway while activating the brain's DRD2/TH signaling pathway and increasing dopamine release in the brain.\nCONCLUSIONS: XYS may regulate the brain-gut axis function and improve intestinal and depressive symptoms in IBS model mice through the intestinal ACT1/TRAF6/P38MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathway and the brain DRD2/TH signaling pathway."

        "abstract": "Addictive substance use disorder has a wide range of effects on the intestinal barrier, including damage to the biological, chemical, mechanical, and immune barriers. Damage to the intestinal barrier caused by addictive substance use disorder allows harmful substances and bacteria to cross the intestinal barrier into the circulatory system, leading to systemic inflammatory responses and immune imbalances. In addition, the interaction between the gut flora and the central nervous system is recognized as an important component of the gut-brain axis. Gut barrier damage leads to dysbiosis, which in turn affects brain function by activating immune cells and releasing inflammatory factors. This may lead to altered mood and cognitive function, increased addictive substance cravings, and dependence. Recent research has indicated that reshaping the gut-brain axis and adjusting the composition and abundance of gut microbiota holds promise in alleviating withdrawal symptoms with addictive substance dependence.

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a common mental disease with a complex pathogenesis and is challenging to treat. Although studies have elucidated the mechanisms associated with the interactions between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and SCZ, few have specifically used probiotics as a therapeutic intervention for SCZ. Accordingly, the current study determines whether L. johnsonii YH1136 effectively prevents SCZ-like behavior in mice and identifies the associated key microbes and metabolites. An SCZ mouse model was established by intraperitoneal injection of MK-801; L. johnsonii YH1136 was administered via oral gavage. L. johnsonii YH1136 significantly improves abnormal behaviors, including psychomotor hyperactivity and sociability and alleviates aberrant enzyme expression associated with tryptophan metabolism in SCZ mice. Additionally, L. johnsonii YH1136 upregulates hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels while downregulating tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2), indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), kynurenine aminotransferase 1 (KAT1). Subsequent 16S rRNA sequencing of intestinal contents suggests that L. johnsonii YH1136 modulates the gut flora structure and composition by increasing the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and decreasing Dubosiella in SCZ mice. N-acetylneuraminic acid and hypoxanthine are the key serum metabolites mediating the interaction between the MGBA and SCZ.

However, the specific alterations in the microbiome associated with migraine remain underexplored. This study aims to systematically review the existing literature to determine whether migraine patients are associated with changes in gut microbiota composition.\nMETHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We included original empirical studies investigating the microbiome in migraine patients. Data extracted included study design, participant demographics, microbiome differences at various taxonomic levels, and measures of microbial diversity (alpha and beta diversity). The search and selection process involved four independent reviewers who assessed abstracts and full texts to ensure eligibility. The gut microbiota was evaluated using relative abundance and diversity indices.\nRESULTS: Six studies, encompassing various regions including China, Korea, and Italy, were included in the analysis. The results indicated significant differences in gut microbiota between migraine patients and controls. Key findings include a reduction in Faecalibacterium, a genus known for its anti-inflammatory properties, in migraine patients, including those with chronic migraine. Conversely, Veillonella exhibited elevated abundance compared to controls. Other taxa, such as Prevotella and Parabacteroides, showed variable associations with migraine across different studies, suggesting a dysbiotic gut environment in migraine patients.\nCONCLUSION: This review highlights that migraines are associated with specific alterations in gut microbiota, including decreased microbial diversity and changes in the abundance of key taxa. These findings suggest that gut microbiota dysbiosis may play a role in migraine pathophysiology. Further research is needed to explore the potential causal relationships and therapeutic implications, particularly targeting the microbiome in migraine management."

There is increasing evidence that probiotics such as Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 can influence mental well-being of adults; however, their impact on mental health during pregnancy and after birth remains unknown. The current double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 3-parallel-arm study (N = 184) evaluated the efficacy of orally consumed B. longum (BL) NCC3001 either during pregnancy and postpartum (from approximately 30 weeks' gestation until 12 weeks after delivery) or postpartum only (from birth until 12 weeks after delivery) compared to a placebo control group in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms assessed by EPDS and STAI self-administered questionnaires in late pregnancy and across 12 weeks postpartum. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe any differences between groups in mood outcomes. Mood scores showed large variability among participants, as well as notable fluctuations within individuals over the course of the study. Additionally, it should be noted that BL NCC3001 was not detected after the intervention in all of the intervention group participants.

Several human and dog studies have demonstrated low-carbohydrate diets and dietary medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementation are effective for seizure reduction, with some patients achieving a seizure-free status. Recent evidence suggests the gut-brain axis has an important role in the pathology of neurological disease among both humans and dogs. Altered gut microbiota may have a major role in treatment-refractory epilepsy.

This information may be critically valuable in designing high-quality, diet-based therapies for epileptic dogs.

This research investigated the potential of transcranial low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) to mitigate colonic inflammation induced by dextran sulphate sodium (DSS), focusing on its effects via the brain-gut axis. Colitis and neuroinflammation were induced in mice by administering 3% (wt/vol) DSS for 7 days. Subsequently, the brain was subjected to LIPUS stimulation at intensities of 0.5 or 1.0 W/cm² for 3 days. Biological samples were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and histological observation. Behavioural dysfunctions were assessed using the open field test, novel object recognition task, and Y-maze test. The alteration in gut microbiota composition was assessed through 16S rRNA sequencing. LIPUS therapy notably alleviated colitis symptoms and suppressed inflammation in both the colon and hippocampus of DSS-exposed mice. Compared with the group treated only with DSS, the LIPUS treatment showed decreased crypt destruction and partial epithelial barrier preservation. Moreover, LIPUS preserved intestinal barrier function by upregulating the levels of occludin and zonula occludens, decreasing the levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein in serum, and ameliorating behavioural disorders. Further analysis indicated that LIPUS did not significantly transform the composition of the intestinal microbiota, but the microbial community showed some differences from the community in the DSS-only treatment group. This study demonstrates that transcranial LIPUS stimulation could be a novel therapeutic strategy for IBD and neuroinflammation via regulation of inflammatory interactions across brain-gut axis."

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), crucial for neuronal development, has been demonstrated to be produced by certain immune cells. However, the modulation of BDNF during bacterial antigen and metabolite challenge remains elusive. We investigate the effects of bacterial-derived antigens and metabolites on BDNF secretion in human PBMCs. Although BDNF levels were altered during stimulation, a specific cellular origin of BDNF within PBMCs was indeterminate. Positive magnetic separation of monocytes eliminated both the stimulant-induced BDNF secretion and reduced monocyte-platelet aggregates. Conversely, elevated platelet counts significantly increased BDNF levels, indicating that platelets, when interacting with monocytes and exposed to bacterial antigens, are likely the dominant source of BDNF in PBMC cultures. As previously described, platelets are a crucial source of circulating peripheral blood BDNF. Our findings emphasize the importance of the interplay between immune-blood cell complexes during microbial stimulation in regulating BDNF levels. This highlights the necessity of investigating such interactions to better understand the early-life gut-brain axis."

The male rats were subjected to mild and moderate TBI, where serum and urine metabolic fingerprints of mild TBI rats showed a hypermetabolic response with increased energy metabolites, amino acids, and gut metabolites in serum and increased TCA cycle intermediates in urine. In contrast, the moderate TBI rats showed decreased lactate, pyruvate, amino acids (glycine and leucine) and gut metabolites [trimethylamine N OXIDE (TMAO), choline and acetate] in serum. The urine showed increased pyruvate, creatinine, and allantoin levels. To understand the brain's role in altered metabolic physiology, hypothalamus structure was assessed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and stress levels were observed using serum corticosterone. The injured rats exhibited changes in DTI metrics in the hypothalamus, suggesting a potential disruption in the regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) axis. These alterations were accompanied by increased TNF-α levels after moderate TBI. The injury induced allostatic overload, accompanied by impaired hypothalamic structure, and metabolic physiology also showed gut microbiome dysbiosis. The gut microbiome showed an increased Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes ratio after injury, with variable gut composition after both injuries. Therefore, the present study provides insight into an interplay between the HPA axis, metabolism, and gut microbiome following TBI. Importantly, this crosstalk between the regulatory systems was different after mild and moderate injury, highlighting the need to assess injury phenotype based on the severity."

Severe CI was associated with increased microbial capacity for methanogenesis, and reduced capacity for synthesis of short-chain fatty acids, neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid, and amino acids required for neuro-protective lysosomal activity. These relationships were independent of age, sex, antibiotic exposure, and diet. Our findings implicate multiple gut microbiome-brain pathways in ageing-associated cognitive decline, including inflammation, neurotransmission, and autophagy, and highlight the potential to predict and prevent cognitive decline through microbiome-targeted strategies."

        "abstract": "Cocaine use disorder (CUD) lacks FDA-approved treatments, partly due to the difficulty of creating therapeutics that target behavior-related neural circuits without disrupting signaling throughout the brain. Recent evidence highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting gut-brain axis components, such as GLP-1 receptors, to modulate neural circuits with minimal central nervous system disruption. Like GLP-1, pituitary adenylate cyclase polypeptide (PACAP) is a component of the gut-brain axis that regulates behavior through a network spanning the gut and brain. Here, we investigated the potential existence and function of an endogenous PACAP signaling network within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc), which is a structure that integrates emotional, cognitive, and reward processes underlying behavior. We found that PACAP and its receptor, PAC1R, are endogenously expressed in the rat NAcc and that PACAP mRNA is present in medial prefrontal cortical projections to the NAcc. Behaviorally, intra-NAcc infusions of PACAP (100 pm) did not induce seeking behavior but blocked cocaine-primed reinstatement (10 mg/kg, IP). Intra-NAcc PACAP also inhibited reinstatement driven by co-infusion of the D1 receptor agonist (SKF 81297, 3 µg) but not the D2 receptor agonist (sumanirole, 10 ng). These findings are significant since D1 and D2 receptor activities in the NAcc govern distinct behavioral mechanisms indicating precise actions of PACAP even within the NAcc. Future research should examine whether NAcc PACAP signaling can be selectively engaged by peripheral gut-brain axis mechanisms, potentially unveiling novel therapeutic approaches for CUD and related disorders."

Emerging evidence has revealed that the microbiota-gut-brain axis plays an important role in AD pathology. However, the role of gut microbiota in different AD stages has not been well characterized. In this study, we performed fecal shotgun metagenomic analysis on a Chinese cohort with 476 participants across five stages of AD pathology to characterize stage-specific alterations in gut microbiota and evaluate their diagnostic potential. We discovered extensive gut dysbiosis that is associated with neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter dysregulation, with over 10% of microbial species and gene families showing significant alterations during AD progression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that microbial gene families exhibited strong diagnostic capabilities, evidenced by an average AUC of 0.80 in cross-validation and 0.75 in independent external validation. In the optimal model, the most discriminant gene families are primarily involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, energy, glycan and vitamins. We found that stage-specific microbial gene families in AD pathology could be validated by an in vitro gut simulator and were associated with specific genera. We also observed that the gut microbiota could affect the progression of cognitive decline in 5xFAD mice through fecal microbiota transplantation, which could be used for early intervention of AD. Our multi-stage large cohort metagenomic analysis demonstrates that alterations in gut microbiota occur from the very early stages of AD pathology, offering important etiological and diagnostic insights."

Earlier research confirms Hyperforin's ability to reduce anhedonic behaviors in mice and modulate gut microbiota. This study aims to identify specific metabolic changes induced by Hyperforin that could illuminate its impact on gut microbiome metabolism, possibly uncovering novel metabolites for developing antidepressant therapies.\nMETHODS: Following the chronic stress model, untargeted metabolomic analysis of fecal samples was conducted to identify metabolic changes induced by Hyperforin. Bioinformatics tools analyzed the origins of differentially expressed metabolites and their correlation with Akkermansia muciniphila and Muribaculum intestinale. The significant metabolite Carbocysteine was further investigated for its antidepressant effects using behavioral assays in a mouse model of depression. Additionally, the response of the colonic mucus barrier was evaluated using Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).\nRESULTS: Hyperforin significantly altered fecal metabolite profiles in stressed mice, with a notable shift in 239 metabolites mainly associated with co-metabolism pathways and microbiota-specific processes. Among these, Carbocysteine emerged as a key metabolite linked to beneficial bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila and Muribaculum intestinale, with its levels significantly elevated following Hyperforin treatment. Behavioral assessments indicated that Carbocysteine supplementation ameliorated depressive-like behaviors in the chronic restraint stress mouse model. It also enhanced colonic mucus production and integrity.\nCONCLUSION: Our research highlights Hyperforin's role in modulating gut microbiota metabolism and identifies Carbocysteine as a potential antidepressant.

Mechanistically, changes in mitochondrial function are related to endoplasmic reticulum stress, reactive oxygen species production, oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, and disrupted calcium ion homeostasis, all of which trigger the activation of signaling cascades that affect the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and interferons. Certain factors present in the gut microbiota ecosystem can influence communication between microorganisms and the brain through the neuroendocrine, immune, and autonomic nervous systems, thereby altering mitochondrial function and cytokine production. This review article explores the means through which mitochondria regulate immune cytokine expression and the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis and treatment of MDD to provide new perspectives for the diagnosis of this disease and the development of novel therapeutic interventions with greater efficacy and improved safety profiles."

Currently, drivers of cognitive decline and symptomatic progression in AD remain unknown and understudied. Changes in gut microbiome composition may offer clues to potential systemic physiologic and neuropathologic changes that contribute to cognitive decline. Here, we recruited a cohort of 260 older adults (age 60+) living in the community and followed them over time, tracking objective measures of cognition, clinical information, and gut microbiomes. Subjects were classified as healthy controls or as having mild cognitive impairment based on cognitive performance. Those with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Diseases with confirmed using serum biomarkers. Using metagenomic sequencing, we found that relative species abundances correlated well with cognition status (MCI or AD). Furthermore, gene pathways analyses suggest certain microbial metabolic pathways to either be correlated with cognitive decline or maintaining cognitive function. Specifically, genes involved in the urea cycle or production of methionine and cysteine predicted worse cognitive performance. Our study suggests that gut microbiome composition may predict AD cognitive performance."

        "abstract": "Low feed intake in weanling pigs can be hypothesized as both cause and consequence to intestinal disturbances and metabolic stress. We explored the associations between individual daily feed intake (FI) patterns, metabolic status and intestinal physiology. Female pigs (n = 24) were selected based on high or low cumulative FI between d1 and d3 relative to weaning (d0) from 12 pens equipped with electronic feeding stations at 1-week after weaning for dissection and sampling. Four classes of pigs were created with pigs which started with a high or low FI (d1 to d3) and continued with a high or low FI (d4 to d6) (HH, HL, LH and LL, respectively; n = 6) for data analysis. In plasma, HL pigs showed higher plasma glutamate dehydrogenase than LL pigs (P < 0.05). A low FI d1 to d3 increased plasma creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase, and reduced insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), gastrointestinal organ weights, and jejunal villus surface area at one week after weaning (P < 0.05). However, low FI d4 to d6 increased plasma haptoglobin, PigMAP, bile acids and bilirubin levels and reduced jejunal villus length (P < 0.05). In jejunum tissue, HH pigs had the highest jejunal upregulated IGF-I receptor and a reduced local inflammatory gene expression when compared to HL pigs (MyD88), and similarly, when compared to all classes (FAXDC2). For the main effects, pigs classified as high FI d1 to d3 had upregulated immune system including IL6, TGFB1, TLR2, and TLR4 genes compared to low FI d1 to d3 pigs (P < 0.05). In a multivariate model, variance in ADG (R2 = 0.82) was mostly explained by positive correlations with FI d1 to d3, jejunal morphometrics, and plasma IGF-I, while negatively explained by histamine in digesta, and creatinine, PigMAP, triglycerides, and haptoglobin in plasma. In conclusion, pigs transitioning from high to a low feed intake showed distinct metabolic alterations and a subtle local inflammation masked by the vigorous local immune response in pigs with initial (d1 to d3) high FI. Pigs with an initial low FI had a fasting-like metabolic state, indicated by hepatic alterations pointing at shifting protein metabolism into energy production. Altogether, feed intake during the initial days postweaning significantly impacts pig growth, immunity, and metabolism, with sustained low intake (i.e. up to 6 days) triggering a systemic inflammatory response."

Without professional guidance, these patients may risk developing avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), potentially affecting their physical and mental health.\nPURPOSE: This scoping review aimed to explore the prevalence of ARFID in patients with neurogastroenterology disorders and vice versa, the direction of their association, potential risk factors, and available treatments.\nMETHODS: Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane. Abstracts were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers.\nKEY RESULTS: Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria. The prevalence of ARFID symptoms in neurogastroenterology patients ranged from 10% to 80%, while the prevalence of neurogastroenterology disorders and related GI symptoms in ARFID patients ranged from 7% to 60%. Findings on the direction of the association between eating difficulties and GI symptom occurrence were conflicting. Patients with ARFID-neurogastroenterology disorder overlap were more likely to be female, have a lower BMI, higher anxiety and depression levels, and poorer quality of life. Two small studies evaluating treatment for this overlap suggested promising effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\nCONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: This review highlights heterogeneity in study designs and questions the suitability of ARFID assessment tools in this context. It also underscores gaps in understanding the underlying pathophysiology and treatment approaches. Future research should prioritize validating ARFID screening tools specific to this population and standardizing study methodologies. Improved understanding of this overlap will help healthcare professionals improve management strategies and patient outcomes."

Recent studies have suggested a potential connection between NDDs and the gut-brain axis. Furthermore, there is evidence indicating that nutritional supplements might have an impact on gastrointestinal (GI) and behavioral symptoms. This study aimed to explore the effects of nutritional supplements on the gut microbiota and behavioral symptoms in individuals with NDDs.\nMETHODS: A systematic search of databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and APA PsycINFO was conducted, utilizing relevant keywords until February 2025. In addition, the search for gray literature was carried out on Google Scholar and ProQuest. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies and the RoB-1 tool for randomized controlled trials. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, a Synthesis without Meta-analysis (SWiM) approach was employed.\nRESULTS: The overall findings from the studies indicated positive effects of supplementation in reducing the Gastrointestinal Severity Index (GIS) score and alleviating GI symptoms. Supplementation with probiotics and vitamins increased good microbiomes (GM) and decrease in bad microbiomes (BM) among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Moreover, the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio (F/R ratio) exhibited significant changes after supplementation. Additionally, improvements were observed in various assessment scores, including ATEC, ABC, CARS, and PGI-2.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nutritional supplementation in individuals with NDDs can have a positive influence by modulating the microbiome, reducing dysbiosis, and enhancing gut barrier integrity. Shifting in the F/R ratio can be considered as the reason for improving gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms by influencing neurotransmitter activity and neuroinflammation. Targeting the gut-brain axis with interventions that focus on gut microbiota offers a promising adjunct therapy for the management of NDD. Registration of the review protocol.

The risk of bacterial infections results in the excessive and preventive use of antibiotics. Therefore, we aimed to study how antibiotic treatment and restraint stress will affect the stress response, microbiota composition, gut morphology, and inflammatory reaction in common carp. Both restraint stress and antibiotic treatment increased cortisol level. Moreover, antibiotics induced dysbiosis in fish gut, manifested by a decrease in the total abundance of bacteria, and a shift in bacteria diversity, including a reduced number of Aeromonas, Bacteroides, Barnesiellaceae, Cetobacterium and Shewanella and an increased abundance of Flavobacterium. To a lesser extent, stress modified gut microbiota, as it decreased bacteria number and slightly changed the microbiota composition by decreasing Cetobacterium abundance and increasing Vibrio abundance. Microbiota of the antibiotic-treated and stressed fish shifted from the beneficial bacterial genera - Cetobacterium and Bacteroides, to the increased presence of unfavorable bacteria such as Brevinema, Flavobacterium and Desulfovibrionaceae. Stress and antibiotic-induced changes in the gut microbiota were related to the changes in the gut morphology when the higher abundance of goblet and rodlet cells and increased secretion activity of goblet cells were observed. Moreover, up-regulation of the expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines involved in the Th17 immune response was present in the gut of the antibiotic-treated and stressed fish. We conclude that in carp antibiotics and stress alter the abundance and composition of the microbiota and induce Th17-dependent inflammatory reaction in the gut. Moreover, our results strongly suggest the interplay of the stress axis and the brain-gut-microbiota axis."

Here, we examine this interaction and determine whether the gut microbiota impacts stress-induced alterations in hippocampal plasticity. Further, we explored whether exposure to the microbial metabolite butyrate is sufficient to counteract stress-induced alterations in synaptic plasticity. We used electrophysiological and molecular experiments in adult male C57/BL6 antibiotic-treated and acutely stressed mice. In electrophysiological experiments we treated hippocampal slices with 3 μM sodium butyrate to explore the effect of this microbial metabolite. We found the presence of the microbiota essential for the enhancement of both short- and long-term potentiation induced by 15 min of acute restraint stress. Furthermore, butyrate exposure effectively restored the stress-induced enhancement of potentiation in slices from microbiome-depleted animals while also enhancing long-term potentiation independent of stress. In addition, alterations of hippocampal synaptic plasticity markers were noted.

Therefore, we evaluated the effects of minocycline treatment on HC diet-induced cardiac damage, anxiety-like behaviour, and bacterial gut dysbiosis in mice. Male BALB/C mice were divided into two groups, which received standard diet or HC diet for 12 weeks. In the 10th week, both groups were subdivided and received water or minocycline (50 mg/kg) by gavage for 15 days. The gut bacterial populations, behavioural parameters, adiposity index, biochemical profile, cardiac oxidative stress indicators, MMPs, cardiac remodelling, and contractile analyses by Langendorff-perfused hearts were analysed. The HC diet induced bacterial gut dysbiosis and anxiety-like behaviour increased the adiposity index with changes in the lipid profile and creatine kinase fraction MB (CK-MB). In the heart, the HC diet increased tissue oxidative stress, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, collagen deposition, and altered cardiac performance. Minocycline treatment reversed diet-induced bacterial gut dysbiosis and anxiety-like behaviour, ameliorated the biochemical profile, diminished oxidative stress, MMP activity, cardiac collagen deposition, and improved cardiac performance.

Greek-Orthodox (Byzantine style) religious fasting is prolonged and similar to a vegan diet. We aimed to evaluate the association between functional gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) with this religious fasting.\nMETHODS: We investigated Romanian participants in the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Study who observe Greek-Orthodox religious fasting, by adding specific questions on religious fasting to the study questionnaire. Data were analyzed in connection with the reported gastrointestinal symptoms.\nRESULTS: 2015 Romanians were included in the analyses. Overall, 716 (35.5%) of the respondents practiced some fasting, of which 446 (62.3%) fasted on Easter and Christmas, 90 (12.6%) observed all fasts, and 625 (87.3%) practiced weekly fasting. Of the latter, 167 (23.3%) fasted every week and 90 (12.6%) reported symptoms during fasting. There were no statistically significant associations between Greek-Orthodox fasting, to any degree, with upper or lower DGBI or gastrointestinal symptoms.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results from this representative sample show that a substantial proportion of the Romanian population adheres to Greek-Orthodox fasting. However, in contrast to the a priori hypothesis, we did not have sufficient evidence that religious fasting is associated with the prevalence of DGBI, or with functional gastrointestinal symptoms."

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Brain infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) in C57BL/6J mice produces an etiologically relevant model of acquired seizures. Dietary changes can modify seizure presentation following TMEV brain infection and influence intestinal microbiome diversity and composition. Intestinal dysbiosis may thus similarly affect seizure burden and antiseizure medicine (ASM) activity in this model, independent of pharmacokinetic effects. We thus sought to define the influence of antibiotic (ABX)-induced gut dysbiosis on acute seizure presentation, anticonvulsant activity of carbamazepine (CBZ), and CBZ pharmacokinetics with TMEV infection.\nMETHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice (4-5 weeks old) received oral ABX or saline (SAL) once daily beginning on arrival through day 7 after TMEV infection (postinfection [p.i.]). Mice were infected with TMEV or phosphate-buffered saline on day 0. Mice received intraperitoneal (20 mg/kg) CBZ or vehicle (VEH) twice daily on days 3-7 p.i. and were assessed for handling-induced seizures 30 min after treatment. Plasma was collected on day 7 p.i. at 15 and 60 min after CBZ administration for bioanalysis.\nRESULTS: TMEV infection induced acute seizures, but ABX-induced gut dysbiosis altered seizure presentation. There were 75% SAL-VEH, 35% SAL-CBZ, 35% ABX-VEH, and 72% ABX-CBZ mice with seizures during the 7-day monitoring period. There was a significant pretreatment × ASM interaction (p = .0001), with differences in seizure burden in SAL- versus ABX-pretreated mice (p = .004). CBZ significantly increased latency to seizure presentation, an effect absent in ABX-CBZ mice. Plasma CBZ concentrations did not differ between SAL and ABX pretreatment groups, suggesting that ABX did not influence CBZ pharmacokinetics.\nSIGNIFICANCE: ABX-induced gut dysbiosis markedly altered acute disease trajectory with TMEV-induced encephalitis, reflecting a novel contribution of the gut microbiome to seizure presentation. ABX-induced gut dysbiosis also significantly changed acute seizure control by CBZ, but did not influence plasma CBZ concentrations. The gut-brain axis is thus an underrecognized contributor to TMEV infection-induced seizures, ASM activity, and disease burden."

Depression, a leading cause of disability worldwide, may be improved by probiotics. The aim of this narrative review is to investigate and synthesize the current evidence linking probiotic food supplementation with depressive symptomology.\nRECENT FINDINGS: The gut and the brain communicate and interact via the MGBA through inflammation and the immune system, short chain fatty acid production, neuronal innervation and activation as well as endocrine and neurotransmitter modulation. Dysregulation of gut-brain pathways are caused by gut dysbiosis and implicated in the onset, persistence and exacerbation of depression related symptoms. Modulation of the gut microbiota via administration of probiotics has shown to reduce depressive symptom severity with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains being the most reported. Probiotics may produce greater benefits in mild depression rather than in chronic, treatment resistant depression. Probiotic supplementation is a promising and safe approach for the prevention of severe depressive disorders in high-risk individuals such as people with subthreshold depression. However, the mechanistic pathways of the MGBA require further investigation and additional human clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the role of probiotics on depression."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in modulating various physiological and pathological processes through its metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which impact immune system development, gastrointestinal health, and brain functions via the gut-brain axis. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in gut microbiota composition, has been linked to neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions, including epilepsy. In dogs, idiopathic epilepsy has been hypothesized to be influenced by gut microbiota composition, although studies on this association are limited and show inconsistent results. Here, we compared the faecal microbiota of idiopathic epileptic drug-naïve dogs and healthy controls. To this aim, we recruited 19 idiopathic epileptic dogs and 17 healthy controls which met stringent inclusion criteria and characterized their faecal microbiome by 16 S rRNA sequencing.\nRESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding age, breed, body condition score, diet, or reproductive status, though males were significantly overrepresented in the idiopathic epileptic group. Epileptic dogs showed a marked reduction in bacterial richness and a trend towards lower evenness (α-diversity) compared to healthy controls, while no differences in community composition (β-diversity) were observed between the two groups. Moreover, a decrease in SCFA-producing bacteria, namely Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, and Blautia, was observed alongside an increase in Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacteroides in epileptic dogs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic epileptic dogs exhibit dysbiosis, with reduced bacterial diversity, loss of beneficial genera, and overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens. These alterations in microbiota diversity and composition may contribute to epilepsy via the gut-brain axis, highlighting the need for further research to explore dietary or probiotic interventions targeting gut microbiota modulation as adjunctive therapies for managing epilepsy in dogs."

Drugs of abuse dysregulate major brain and behavioral functions. Glial cells, primarily microglia and astrocytes, play a crucial role in these drug-induced molecular and behavioral changes. This review explores preclinical and clinical studies of how neuroglia and their associated neuroinflammatory responses contribute to SUD and reward-related properties. We evaluate preclinical and clinical evidence for targeting neuroglia as therapeutic interventions. In addition, we evaluate the literature on the gut microbiome and its role in SUD. Clinical treatments are most effective for reducing drug cravings, and some have yielded promising results in other measures of drug use. N-Acetylcysteine, through modulation of cysteine-glutamate antiporter of glial cells, shows encouraging results across a variety of drug classes. Neuroglia and gut microbiome interactions are important factors to consider with regard to SUD and could lead to novel therapeutic avenues. Age- and sex-dependent properties of neuroglia, gut microbiome, and drug use behaviors are important areas in need of further investigation."

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate and butyrate, are key metabolites produced by gut bacteria that influence brain function, immune responses and behaviour. We conducted a cross-sectional observational study with 123 patients (86 with SZ and 37 with BD). We analysed faecal samples for SCFA and examined associations with clinical (psychopathology and cognition), metabolic and lifestyle factors. We performed analysis of covariance to find differences in SCFA levels between diagnostic groups, adjusting for covariates. Faecal SCFA levels were numerically higher in the SZ group than in the BD group. However, after adjusting for covariates, a significant sex-by-diagnosis interaction was observed only for acetate levels. Body mass index emerged as a key predictor of SCFA levels but we observed no significant associations with other metabolic or lifestyle variables, including diet, physical activity and blood inflammatory biomarkers. Additionally, SCFA levels showed no correlation with symptom severity or cognitive performance in either group. This study is the first to compare SCFA profiles between SZ and BD, highlighting potential differences in gut microbiota-derived metabolites between these disorders. These findings suggest greater disruption of the gut-brain axis in SZ, potentially reflecting distinct pathophysiological mechanisms involving metabolic and sex-related factors. Further research, including blood SCFA measurements, could better explain the role of SCFAs and explore microbiota-targeted therapeutic strategies for SZ and BD."

Overall, reported exposure to NGM was low (53.9%), mainly occurred during discussions on rounds, and was more common among surgeons (84.8% vs. 41.5%, p < 0.001). Overall, only 9.1% felt NGM was addressed at a moderate or high level, whereas only 13.3% felt knowledgeable enough to treat patients at a moderate or high level. Comfort with NGM diagnostic testing was also low, especially for anorectal manometry. When asked to rate their comfort with the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of eight diseases (4 NGM, 4 organic), comfort scores were significantly lower for the NGM disorders across all three domains for the whole population, as well as for internal medicine and surgical trainees individually (all p < 0.003).\nCONCLUSIONS: Exposure to NGM during residency training is low, with trainees often feeling inadequately prepared. This appears to be worse for internal medicine trainees than for general surgery trainees. Strategies to increase exposure and knowledge of NGM during residency training are needed."

Traditional IBS management emphasizes dietary modifications and pharmacologic therapies. However, increasing attention has been directed toward functional foods, nutraceuticals, and herbal remedies due to their potential to target IBS pathophysiological mechanisms with favorable safety profiles. This clinical review explores the role of these adjunctive therapies, evaluating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies. Functional foods such as kiwifruit, prunes, and rye bread demonstrate benefits in bowel habit regulation through fiber content and microbiota modulation. Nutraceuticals like peppermint oil, palmitoylethanolamide, and herbal mixtures exhibit anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and analgesic effects. Prebiotics provide substrate-driven microbiota changes, although dosage is key, as given their fermentative properties, when used at high dosages, they can exacerbate symptoms in some individuals. Probiotics and postbiotics offer microbiota-based interventions with promising symptom relief in IBS subtypes, although factors for personalized treatment still need to be further elucidated. These strategies highlight a paradigm shift in IBS management, integrating diet-based therapies with evolving nutraceutical options to improve patient outcomes. Despite promising findings, challenges in standardizing definitions, mechanisms, and safety profiles still remain. Rigorous, large-scale trials to validate the therapeutic potential of these interventions are needed, to enhance the benefits of these compounds with an individualized treatment approach."

The consequent health implications impact both short-term and long-term health and well-being. This study aimed to explore the relationship between mental health status, alcohol consumption patterns, and gut microbiome alterations in firefighters from two different regions-America and Korea. By investigating these relationships, we hope to gain insights into how repeated exposure to severe stressors impacts gut health. Healthy male firefighters (ages 21-50) and controls (matched sex, geography, and age) were recruited via flyers and snowball sampling in the United States and South Korea, resulting in 203 participants (102 firefighters and 101 controls). Firefighters reported significantly higher PTSD symptoms and depression and drank 2.3 times more alcohol than the control group. American firefighters reported more drinking than Koreans. There was a significant correlation between higher alcohol consumption and the likelihood of witnessing deaths by suicide. However, there were no correlations between alcohol consumption and PTSD symptom severity. There were associations between alcohol consumption patterns and aspects of the gut microbiome. This study highlights the mental health challenges faced by firefighters, including elevated rates of PTSD, depression, and alcohol consumption, with specific microbial imbalances linked to PTSD and alcohol use, emphasizing the role of the gut-brain axis."

The cross-beta sheet structure characteristic of amyloids produced by gut-colonizing bacteria remains intact, crucial for the resilience of biofilms. These amyloids exacerbate neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by cross-seeding human amyloidogenic proteins like amyloid-beta and α-synuclein, accelerating their misfolding and aggregation. Despite molecular chaperones and heat shock proteins maintaining protein homeostasis, bacterial amyloids can overwhelm them, worsening neuronal damage. Genetic variations in chaperone genes further influence amyloidogenesis and neurodegeneration. Persistent bacterial infections and inflammation compromise the blood-brain barrier, allowing inflammatory molecules and amyloids to enter the brain, perpetuating the cycle of neurodegeneration. The gut-brain axis underscores the impact of dysbiosis and gut microbiota on brain function, potentially contributing to neurodegeneration. The enhancement of biofilm resilience and antibiotic resistance by functional amyloid fibrils complicates the treatment landscape.

However, its dysfunction, often driven by peripheral inflammatory processes, has been increasingly linked to the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut-brain axis plays a key role in BBB integrity, with intestinal dysbiosis and chronic inflammation contributing to barrier disruption through immune and metabolic pathways. Furthermore, the selective vulnerability of specific brain regions to BBB dysfunction appears to be influenced by regional differences in vascularization, metabolic activity, and permeability, making certain areas more susceptible to neurodegenerative processes. This review explored the molecular mechanisms linking peripheral inflammation, gut microbiota, and BBB dysfunction, emphasizing their role in neurodegeneration. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Wiley, ScienceDirect, and Medline, covering publications from 2015 to 2025. The findings highlight a complex interplay between gut microbiota-derived metabolites, immune signaling, and BBB permeability, underscoring the need for targeted interventions such as microbiome modulation, anti-inflammatory therapies, and advanced drug delivery systems. The heterogeneity of the BBB across different brain regions necessitates the development of region-specific therapeutic strategies. Despite advancements, critical knowledge gaps persist regarding the precise mechanisms underlying BBB dysfunction. Future research should leverage cutting-edge methodologies such as single-cell transcriptomics and organ-on-chip models to translate preclinical findings into effective clinical applications. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for developing personalized therapeutic approaches to mitigate the impact of BBB dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases."

        "abstract": "The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) has emerged as a critical frontier in understanding neurological disorders, including epilepsy. Microbial disequilibrium potentially alters brain homeostasis and could potentiate an inflammatory state linking intestinal dysbiosis and intractable seizures. The current study sought to probe the anti-kindling, electrographical, behavioral and neuropathological impacts of combined intervention of probiotics (PRO; 10 ml/kg) and pregabalin (PRG; 10 mg/kg) in PTZ-induced epileptic mice for 21 days. Adult BALB/c mice were kindled via subthreshold dose of (PTZ 40 mg/kg) until mice reached seizure stage of 4-5. After the procedure, mice were tested using a set of behavioral tests, and redox alterations along with cellular pathology were assessed. vEEG monitoring revealed that kindling instigated recurrent polyspikes of high amplitude with generalized epileptic seizures which were markedly impeded in the mice treated with dual regime suggesting potential preventive impact of probiotic therapy on neuronal hyperexcitability. Additionally, combination intervention exerted positive behavioral outcomes as it ameliorated anxiety and depressive-like phenotypes along with cognitive impairments (P < 0.05) vs. PTZ control. Moreover, probiotic and pregabalin therapy incurred gut-microbiota antioxidant neuroprotection and prevented morbid neurodegeneration as evidenced by decreased production of oxidative stressors (MDA and AchE; p < 0.01) and increase in activity of antioxidant factors (SOD; P < 0.01 and CAT; P < 0.05). Furthermore, these commensal species and PRG duo regulates inflammation and halted neuronal apoptosis in CA1 and CA3 subfields of the cornu-ammonis. Overall, our findings support probiotics as an adjuvant therapy to shift treatment paradigms in drug-resistant epilepsy by altering gut-microbiome pathological neural links."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Deoxynivalenol (DON) poses a threat to animal and human health, particularly causing damage to the nervous system. Intestinal flora can regulate the nervous system through the gut-brain axis; however, there is currently a lack of evidence on the effect of changing the intestinal flora on the damage to the nervous system caused by DON. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of gut microbiota ablation on neurotoxicity induced by exposure to deoxynivalenol.\nMETHODS: One hundred-twenty (120) specific pathogen-free (SPF) male C57BL/6j mice were randomly divided into four groups (control group, microbiota-uncleaned group + 5 mg/kg/BW DON, microbiota-cleared group, and microbiota-cleared group + 5 mg/kg/BW DON). The open field and Morris behavior tests were used to evaluate behavior changes after DON exposure. After 14 days of treatment, the mice were euthanized and brain tissues were collected for further analysis.\nRESULTS: The tests showed that DON exposure led to anxiety and decreased learning ability in mice with no gut microbiota ablation. We also observed pathological changes including neuronal shrinkage, degeneration, and cortical edema in the mice with no microbiota ablation after DON exposure. In addition, the protein and mRNA levels of tight junction proteins and anti-inflammatory factors were decreased in the mice with no microbiota ablation after DON exposure compared with mice with ablated microbiota.\nCONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the presence of microbiota plays a key role in the neurotoxicity induced by DON; thus, ablation of the intestinal microbiota can effectively improve brain damage caused by DON."

Furthermore, the roles of gut microbiome dyshomeostasis in their pathogeneses are just beginning to be uncovered, adding to another level of complexity. In recent years, significant efforts have been directed toward discovering multimodal yet safe therapeutics to counteract psychological deficits. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a polyphenol found in several medicinal herbs, has received considerable attention as a potential multifaceted therapeutic agent, particularly for neuropsychiatric conditions. In order to critically evaluate this aspect, data was compiled and consolidated after extensive searches on scholarly databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Peer-reviewed publications which focused on RA as a therapeutic agent for psychiatric disorders were included regardless of the year of publication and country of origin. Based on pre-clinical and clinical evidence, this review delves into the various mechanistic aspects of the antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep-promoting functions of RA. The beneficial effects of RA on the gut-microbiome-brain (GMB) axis and their implications for the regulation of neuroprotective pathways are also discussed, with a particular focus on exploiting them to ameliorate neuropsychiatric conditions. Our assessment indicated that RA is a multimodal neuroprotectant against psychiatric conditions and beneficially influences a plethora of targets related to redox, inflammatory, synaptic, cell death, neurotrophic, and cell signaling pathways. As a dietary agent, RA may also be relevant in favorably altering the GMB axis, indicating its prospects as a potential multimodal adjuvant therapeutic agent in regulating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric conditions. However, more extensive clinical studies are required to ascertain the neuromodulatory actions of RA in neuronal pathophysiologies, including psychiatric ailments."

Ghrelin is a brain-gut peptide that regulates the microbiota-brain-gut axis, facilitating communication between the GI tract and the central nervous system. This study aimed to investigate the role of ferulic acid (FA) in regulating Ghrelin to improve TBI and GI disorders (GID) induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI). This study used CCI as the in vivo TBI model and scratch-induced injury of primary astrocytes as the in vitro TBI model. The role and mechanism of FA modulation of Ghrelin in ameliorating TBI and GID were explored using multi-omics and network pharmacology analyses. In vivo, results revealed that FA is the main active component of the Guanxin II compound and mimics its function. Significant improvement in GI hypomotility and brain injury was observed in the FA group compared to the CCI group. Concurrently, FA ameliorated intestinal barrier impairment triggered by CCI-induced reduction in the expression of Ghrelin and reduces the inflammatory response. Furthermore, 16S rRNA results indicated that CCI-induced TBI worsened gut microflora imbalance via the brain-gut axis, while gut dysbiosis aggravated brain injury. FA improved the dysbiosis of Bacteroidetes and Odoribacter mainly by targeting the Ghrelin-mediated inflammatory response. RNA-seq and network pharmacology analyses revealed that FA mainly affects inflammation-mediated pyroptosis pathways in the brain-gut axis. Additionally, experimental evidence demonstrated that FA reversed CCI-induced pyroptosis in rats and scratch injury-induced pyroptosis in astrocytes by promoting the binding of Ghrelin to GHSR, which suppressed the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway. Conclusively, FA could alleviate TBI and GID by promoting Ghrelin to regulate the microbiota-brain-gut axis inflammation via the Ghrelin/TLR4/NLRP3 pathway."

However, few studies have examined the potential links among the gut microbiome, brain structure and function, and clinical manifestation in SZ patients, and the effects of prolonged antipsychotic treatment are often neglected.\nSTUDY DESIGN: A total of 171 participants were enrolled, including 27 drug-naïve first-episode SZ patients (FSZ), 72 chronically antipsychotics-treated SZ patients (CSZ), and 72 healthy controls (HCs). Multi-omics data, including fecal 16S rRNA sequencing, structural and functional brain imaging analyses, and assessments of psychotic symptoms and cognitive function, were obtained to characterize the microbiome-gut-brain axis in SZ patients. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted to assess the relationships among the gut microbiome, neuroimaging features, and clinical manifestations.\nSTUDY RESULTS: Compared with HCs, 3 key diagnostic genera were identified in SZ, characterized by decreased abundance of Blautia (FSZ/CSZ < HCs) and increased abundance of Proteus and Arthrobacter (FSZ > CSZ > HCs). This microbial dysbiosis was accompanied by down-regulated bile acids biosynthesis and up-regulated lipid metabolism. Further analyses revealed a tripartite relationship among the key microbial genera, altered brain structure and function, and clinical manifestation in separate SZ subgroups. Importantly, higher abundance of Proteus may result in lower scores on several cognitive domains by disrupting gray matter volume and regional homogeneity in specific brain regions.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work advances our knowledge of microbiota-gut-brain disturbances and its potential role on cognitive performance in SZ. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of considering antipsychotic exposure in gut-brain research."

The composition of the gut microbiome is associated with different neurological and neurodevelopmental diseases. In psychiatric disease, stress may be a major factor leading to gut microbiota alterations. Depressive disorders are the most prevalent mental health issues worldwide and patients often report gastrointestinal symptoms. Accordingly, evidence of gut microbial alterations in depressive disorders has been growing. Here we review current literature revealing links between the gut microbiome and brain function in the context of depression.\nRECENT FINDINGS: The gut-brain axis could impact the behavioral manifestation of depression and the underlying neuropathology via multiple routes: the HPA axis, immune function, the enteric nervous system, and the vagus nerve. Furthermore, we explore possible therapeutic interventions including fecal microbiota transplant or probiotic supplementation in alleviating depressive symptoms.\nSUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms by which bidirectional communication along the gut-brain axis can be dysregulated in patients with depression could lead to the development of personalized, microbiome-targeted therapies for the treatment of this disorder."

Interestingly, this study based on the brain-gut axis provided a novel point of view to interpret the mechanism of PHN. Past neuroanatomical and neuroimaging studies of pain suggest that the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and other regions of the brain may play crucial roles in the descending inhibition of PHN. Dominant bacterial species in patients with PHN, such as Lactobacillus, generate short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate. Evidence indicates that disturbance of some metabolites (such as butyrate) is closely related to the development of hyperalgesia. In addition, tryptophan and 5-HT in the intestinal tract act as neurotransmitters that regulate the descending transmission of neuropathic pain signals. Concurrently, the enteric nervous system establishes close connections with the central nervous system through the vagus nerve and other pathways. This review aims to investigate and elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with PHN, focusing on the interplay among PHN, the gut microbiota, and relevant metabolites while scrutinizing its pathogenesis."

Research has suggested that dopamine (DA) exerts a protective effect on the gastroduodenal and colonic mucosa. The present study aimed to explore the effect of DA on NSAID-induced injury to the small intestinal mucosa.\nMETHODS: A mouse model of enteropathy induced by indomethacin (Indo, which is a commonly used NSAID) was established by gavage. The DA agonist rotigotine (Roti) was administered alone or in combination with the DA receptor 2 (DRD2) antagonist domperidone (Domp) to model mice to determine the effect of Roti and the key role of DRD2 in this effect. Bilateral vagotomy was performed to determine whether the effect of Roti was mediated by the brain‒gut axis.\nRESULTS: Roti administration attenuated small intestinal injury in Indo-induced model mice. However, Domp administration alone exacerbated this injury. Moreover, Roti mitigated small intestinal injury by increasing Occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression and decreasing TNF-α and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression. However, the effects of Roti were abrogated by Domp. In contrast to Domp, vagotomy before Indo administration did not alter the enteroprotective effects of Roti.\nCONCLUSION: The DA receptor agonist Roti attenuated Indo-induced enteropathy via peripheral DRD2 and could be a potential drug for treating NSAID-mediated enteropathy."

However, emerging evidence suggests a potential link between IBD and an increased risk of stroke, likely mediated by chronic systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and a prothrombotic state. Despite this growing recognition, the exact mechanisms and extent of this association remain unclear, highlighting a critical knowledge gap. This review aims to systematically analyze the association between IBD and stroke, exploring the underlying vascular mechanisms and identifying potential risk factors contributing to cerebrovascular events in IBD patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines across PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using keywords such as \"IBD,\" \"Stroke,\" \"Chronic inflammation,\" \"Cerebrovascular risk,\" and \"Gut-brain axis.\" After screening 150 studies and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, six studies were included in the final synthesis. The findings suggest that chronic inflammation in IBD plays a key role in increasing stroke risk through endothelial dysfunction and a heightened prothrombotic state, with additional risk factors such as atrial fibrillation during active IBD flares further contributing to cerebrovascular events. While biologic therapies, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors, are effective in reducing systemic inflammation, their impact on mitigating stroke risk remains inconclusive. Given the potential role of IBD as an independent risk factor for stroke, a multidisciplinary approach to management is crucial. Addressing modifiable risk factors through pharmacologic interventions such as biologics, statins, and antiplatelet agents, alongside lifestyle modifications, could help reduce cerebrovascular complications in IBD patients. Further research is needed to explore personalized therapeutic strategies and establish clearer preventive guidelines for this at-risk population."

These microbes generally live in harmony with the host; however, when dysbiosis occurs, it can contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases, including osteoporosis. Osteoporosis, a systemic skeletal disease characterized by reduced bone mass and increased fracture risk, has attracted significant research attention concerning the role of gut microbes in its development. Advances in molecular biology have highlighted the influence of gut microbiota on osteoporosis through mechanisms involving immunoregulation, modulation of the gut-brain axis, and regulation of the intestinal barrier and nutrient absorption. These microbes can enhance bone mass by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, inducing apoptosis, reducing bone resorption, and promoting osteoblast proliferation and maturation. Despite these promising findings, the therapeutic effectiveness of targeting gut microbes in osteoporosis requires further investigation. Notably, gut microbiota has been increasingly studied for their potential in early diagnosis, intervention, and as an adjunct therapy for osteoporosis, suggesting a growing utility in improving bone health.

To summarize the rules and mechanisms of comorbidities in a complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced pain model, we conducted a systematic review of 66 experimental studies identified in a search of three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect). Anxiety-like behaviors developed at 1- or 3-days post-CFA induction but also appeared between 2- and 4 weeks post-induction. Pain aversion, pain depression, and cognitive impairments were primarily observed within 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2-4 weeks post-CFA injection, respectively.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A growing body of evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may contribute to changes in brain morphology. The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) has been shown to influence neurogenesis, axon myelination, and synapse structure. However, it remains unclear whether the MGBA can influence the morphology and density of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. The aim of this study was to determine whether antibiotic-induced dysbiosis (AID) is associated with alterations in dendritic morphology of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC), somatosensory cortex (SSC), motor cortex (MC), and hippocampus (Hp).\nMETHODS: A cohort of six-month-old GAD-67-EGFP transgenic mice was treated with an antibiotic cocktail for two weeks, resulting in gut dysbiosis as validated by collecting stool samples at baseline and after treatment, then using next-generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA.\nRESULTS: The results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively exhibited the defining features of gut dysbiosis, including a significant reduction in microbiome diversity, expansion of pathobionts, and loss of beneficial microbes. The AID group showed alterations in density and morphology of GABAergic interneurons in different brain areas. The mean dendritic length and mean dendritic segments of the SSC and Hp were found to be significantly decreased, while no such decrease was observed in the mEC or MC. Furthermore, the density of interneurons was decreased in the mEC, Hp, and SSC areas, while no change was observed in the MC area.\nDISCUSSION: The interneuron dysfunction plays a role in the pathogenesis of neurological disease. The findings of this study suggest that AID potentially influences the density and morphology of the interneurons, which may contribute to the development of neurological disorders."

The gut microbiota and the brain communicate in a bidirectional manner across multiple signaling pathways and interfaces that together comprise the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Here, we detail the role of glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system, and glial cells in the enteric nervous system along this gut-brain axis. We review what is known regarding the modulation of glia by microbial signals, in particular by microbial metabolites which signal to the brain through systemic circulation and via the vagus nerve. In addition, we highlight what is yet to be discovered regarding the role of other gut microbiota signaling pathways in glial cell modulation and the challenges of research in this area."

The objective was to identify potential microbial signatures that could serve as biomarkers for cognitive deterioration.\nMETHODS: Forty-seven participants were recruited, including 13 with aMCI, 20 with SCD, and 14 normal cognition (NC). Blood samples were collected, and microbial DNA was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Bioinformatics analyses-including α- and β-diversity measures and differential abundance testing (using edgeR)-were employed to assess microbial diversity and differences in bacterial composition among groups. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the predictive impact of the microbiota on cognitive decline.\nRESULTS: Microbial diversity differed significantly between groups, with NC exhibiting the highest α-diversity. Both the aMCI and SCD groups showed reduced diversity. Taxa such as Bacteroidia, Alphaproteobacteria, and Clostridia were significantly decreased in the aMCI group compared to NC (p<0.05). In contrast, Gammaproteobacteria increased significantly in the aMCI group compared to both NC and SCD, indicating progressive microbial changes from SCD to aMCI. No significant differences were found between the NC and SCD groups.\nCONCLUSION: Distinct bacterial taxa-particularly the increase in Gammaproteobacteria along with decreases in Bacteroidia, Alphaproteobacteria, and Clostridia-are associated with the progression of cognitive decline. These findings suggest that blood microbiota could serve as potential biomarkers for the early detection of aMCI. However, the small sample size and the lack of control for confounding factors such as diet and medication limit the findings. Larger studies are needed to validate these results and further explore the role of microbiota in neurodegeneration."

To fill this gap, we supplemented the diet of 3xTg-AD Alzheimer's disease mice with a red lentils (prebiotic)-based cookie enriched with neuroprotective probiotics and we performed behavioural, biochemical and molecular tests. Chronic consumption of this synbiotic preparation (functional cookie) preserved cognition, reduced amyloid load, improved glucose and lipid homeostasis and diminished oxidation and inflammation related damages compared to animals receiving a classic cookie (standard recipe). The synergistic effect was indicated by significantly higher glucose insulinotropic polypeptide concentrations in the functional cookie group compared to probiotic group. Moreover, Ruminoclostridium sp KB18 and Ruminicoccus decreased in the gut of mice supplemented with the functional cookie, partially explaining the improved short-term memory upon treatments and substantiating the combined use over individual components.

Here, we show that chronic stress-induced activation of the central amygdala-dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (CeA-DMV) pathway accelerates premature aging and impairs the stemness of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). This pathway influences ISC function independently of the microbiota, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the immune response, and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Under chronic stress, DMV-mediated vagal activation prompts cholinergic enteric neurons to release acetylcholine (ACh), which engages ISCs via the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRM3). This interaction activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, triggering growth arrest and mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby accelerating an aging-like decline in ISCs. Together, our findings provide insights into an alternative neural mechanism that links stress to intestinal dysfunction. Strategies targeting the DMV-associated vagal pathway represent potential therapeutic approaches for stress-induced intestinal diseases."

Age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were also recruited. A food diary was used to evaluate nutritional habits, and the Rome IV questionnaire was used to record gastrointestinal symptoms. The microbiota composition was assessed in stool samples through 16S rRNA. α-Diversity (AD) and β-diversity (BD) were calculated, and differential abundance analysis was performed using linear multivariable models (significance: p.adj < .05).\nRESULTS: Forty-one patients (MR:MS = 20:21) with a mean age of 7.2 years (±4.6 SD) and 27 age-matched HCs were recruited. No significant differences in AD were found when comparing patients and HCs.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the major metabolites of the gut microbiota and key regulators of the gut-brain axis, support physiological homeostasis through multiple mechanisms. Recent studies have indicated that SCFAs not only regulate seizures by maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and modulating intestinal immune responses, but also affect the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and regulate neuroinflammation. This review, based on current literatures, explores the relationship between SCFAs and epilepsy, emphasizing how SCFAs affect epilepsy by modulating the intestinal barrier and BBB.

Elle initie un axe de communication nerveux entre l’intestin et le cerveau. Son activation stimulée par l’ingestion de fibres ou de protéines alimentaires, améliore le contrôle de l’équilibre énergétique de l’organisme.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, affecting around 11% of individuals globally. It is linked to dysregulation of the brain-gut axis, with altered activity and connectivity in various brain regions. IBS patients often have psychiatric comorbidities like anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment option for severe, therapy-refractory OCD. It has been suggested that DBS for OCD could also have a beneficial effect on accompanying IBS-symptoms.\nMETHODS AND PATIENTS: Nine patients with treatment-refractory OCD who underwent DBS in the bed nucleus striae terminalis (BNST) have been included in this study (4 males, 5 females, mean age: 39.1 ± 11.5 years). Patients were examined with the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (GSRS-IBS) as well as the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) both before the beginning of DBS as well as throughout several follow-up visits for 12 months following the start of DBS.\nRESULTS: Three patients displayed clinically relevant levels of IBS-symptoms at baseline (GSRS-IBS scores at or beyond 32). All of those three patients showed a reduction of the GSRS-IBS score at the last follow-up (12-40%). For the other 6 patients, 5 of them showed also a reduction of the GSRS-IBS compared to the score at baseline. The mean score for all patients showed a descriptive trend toward score reduction throughout the study period and until the last follow up visit after 12 months. The mean Y-BOCS decreased from 31.11 at baseline to 16.50 at the last follow-up. Out of the 9 patients, 7 (78%) were considered responders with Y-BOCS scores decreasing between 37% to 74%. Moderate-to-large correlations between both scales could be observed at both the 9-month and the 12-month follow-up visit. However, none of these associations was statistically significant.\nCONCLUSION: In this study, we found alleviation of IBS symptoms after DBS of the BNST, along with improvement in OCD symptoms. Future research using larger sample sizes should address whether the reductions are tied to the improvement of OCD symptoms or if DBS exerts positive effects on IBS independently of OCD symptoms."

        "year": "2025",
        "abstract": "Despite being classified as neurodevelopmental disorders, in recent years, there has been a growing interest in the association between autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and gut pathology. This comprehensive and systematic review explores a potential mechanism underlying gut pathology in ASDs, including alterations in gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, immune dysregulation, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Specifically, it delves into the role of toxic and essential metals and their interplay, affecting the development and function of the GI tract. The review also discusses the potential implications of this gut pathology in the development and management of ASDs. Studies have shown that heavy metal exposure, whether through environmental sources or dietary intake, can disrupt the delicate balance of trace elements in the gut. This disruption can adversely affect zinc homeostasis, potentially exacerbating gut pathology in individuals with ASDs. The impaired zinc absorption resulting from heavy metal exposure may contribute to the immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation observed in the gut of individuals with ASDs. By shedding light on the multifaceted nature of gut pathology, including the impact of metal dyshomeostasis as a non-genetic factor in ASD, this review underscores the significance of the gut-brain axis in the etiology and management of ASDs."

Emerging research suggests that A. muciniphila also influences neurobehavioral domains through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This meta-analysis evaluates A. muciniphila's impact on depression, anxiety, and stress in mouse models.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Science Direct, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to March 2024, identifying 15 eligible studies.\nRESULTS: Supplementation with A. muciniphila, its outer membrane protein (Amuc_1100), and extracellular vesicles (EVs) alleviated anxiety, depressive-like behaviors, and enhanced memory in mice. Compared to controls, intervention groups exhibited reduced anxiety-like behaviors, including increased travel distance in the open-field test (OFT) and more time spent in the lightbox during the light-dark box (LDB) test and open arms in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Depression-like symptoms were reduced, with lower immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swim tests. Memory function also improved, and learning time was reduced in the Y-maze and Barnes circular maze tests. Serotonin levels increased significantly in the serum and hippocampus, while corticosterone levels decreased, though not significantly. The intervention reduced hippocampal and serum inflammatory markers (TNFα, IL1β, IL6) and altered gut microbiome composition, increasing Akkermansia, Roseburia, Caldicoprobacter, and Lachnospiraceae.\nCONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the health-promoting effects of A. muciniphila, one of the next-generation probiotics, in alleviating neuropsychiatric disorders. Given the high prevalence and clinical significance of depression, anxiety, and stress, further investigation into the therapeutic utility of A. muciniphila is warranted."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurological condition caused by various factors. Diet, oxidative stress, and the gut microbiota all play critical roles in the development of AD. Recent studies suggested a bidirectional relationship between the gut and the brain, emphasizing the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in influencing cognitive functions. For instance, dysbiosis, a disruption in the balance of gut microbial communities, has been linked to neuroinflammation and the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques, hallmark features of AD. Oxidative stress, arising from an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants, contributes significantly to AD pathology. The molecular mechanisms through which oxidative stress impacts neuronal health and exacerbates the cognitive decline in AD patients are also relevant. Moreover, nutritional interventions emerge as promising strategies to modulate these inflecting factors. Dietary components, such as antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols, exhibit neuroprotective effects, potentially mitigating AD progression. In contrast, the Western diet has a high potential to abet AD onset. Mediterranean diet and/or intermittent fasting are more valuable diets that may help delay the AD onset or progression. Limitations like individual differences affect the efficacy of nutritional interventions. As a supporting therapy, personalized diets should be applied according to the patients' special needs/microbiomes in the future. To gather current knowledge on the interconnected roles of the gut microbiome, oxidative stress, and nutritional interventions in AD is crucial. Understanding these interactions may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches, as well as disputing the potential diets that can help improve AD patients' quality of life."

Most studies of the gut microbiota use mammals in biomedical contexts; much less is known regarding wildlife species. We used larval amphibians to study the impact of the aquatic microbial environment on the gut and skin microbiota, brain, and antipredator behavior. We raised Northern Leopard Frog (Lithobates pipiens) tadpoles in pond water that was autoclaved or not autoclaved (natural); other studies show that these treatments produce variation in the tadpole gut microbiota. Tadpoles were also raised in the presence of stressors: predation-derived chemical cues and corticosterone. Compared to tadpoles raised in natural pond water, tadpoles raised in autoclaved pond water had altered gut and skin microbial communities, body size, brain size, brain shape and behavioral responses to alarm pheromones. There was no effect of microbial environment or stressors on differential gene expression of the whole brain. The gut microbiota, but not the skin microbiota, was a significant predictor of behavioral endpoints. We found surprisingly few impacts of stressors on the tadpoles, although stressor treatments interacted with pond water treatments to influence the composition of the gut microbiota. Our findings demonstrate that tadpole behavior is modulated by the aquatic microbial community experienced during development in ways that are likely to affect survival."

To summarize the effects of BBR on depression in terms of in vitro or in vivo experiments, we searched electronic databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Wanfang Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, from inception until May 2024. Then, we summarize that BBR has indirect antidepressant properties to improve depressive symptoms, manifesting in modulating the gut microbial community, strengthening the intestinal barrier, increasing the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, and regulating tryptophan metabolism. BBR also exerts antidepressant-like effects via remodulating nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element pathway, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-delta. Nevertheless, further clinical trials and more high-quality animal studies are needed to show the actual clinical value of BBR for depression."

Nevertheless, the role of the gut (which is acknowledged as being the largest immune organ) in the immunoreactive effects of polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) on acute ischemic stroke remains inadequately understood. In addition to its function in nutrient absorption, the gut acts as a protective barrier against microbes. Systemic immune responses, which are triggered by the disruption of gut barrier integrity, are considered as one of the mechanisms underlying acute ischemic stroke, with the gut-brain axis (GBA) playing a pivotal role in this process.\nMETHODS: In this study, we used a PDA intervention in an ACI model to investigate ACI-like behavior, intestinal barrier function, central and peripheral inflammation, and hippocampal neuron excitability, thus aiming to elucidate the mechanisms through which PDA improves ACI via the GBA.\nRESULTS: Our findings indicated that as ACI mice experienced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier damage, the levels of proinflammatory factors in the serum and brain significantly increased. Additionally, the activation of astrocytes in the hippocampal region and neuronal apoptosis were observed in ACI mice. Importantly, our study is the first to provide evidence demonstrating that PDA effectively suppresses the neuroimmune interactions of the gut-brain axis and significantly improves intestinal epithelial barrier integrity.\nCONCLUSION: We hope that our discoveries will serve as a foundation for further explorations of the therapeutic mechanisms of PDA in ACI, particularly in elucidating the protective roles of gut microbiota and intestinal barrier function, as well as in the development of more targeted clinical interventions for ACI."

The incidence of stroke exhibits regional variability, with ischemic stroke accounting for the majority of occurrences. Post-stroke complications, such as cognitive impairment, motor dysfunction, and recurrent stroke, profoundly affect patients' quality of life. Recent advancements have elucidated the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), underscoring the complex interplay between gut health and brain function. Dysbiosis, characterized by an imbalance in gut microbiota, is significantly linked to an elevated risk of stroke and unfavorable outcomes. The MGBA plays a crucial role in modulating immune function, neurotransmitter levels, and metabolic byproducts, which may intensify neuroinflammation and impair cerebral health. This review elucidates the role of MGBA in stroke pathophysiology and explores potential gut-targeted therapeutic strategies to reduce stroke risk and promote recovery, including probiotics, prebiotics, pharmacological interventions, and dietary modifications. However, the current prevention and treatment strategies based on intestinal flora still face many problems, such as the large difference of individual intestinal flora, the stability of efficacy, and the long-term safety need to be considered. Further research needs to be strengthened to promote its better application in clinical practice."

        "abstract": "Post-stroke depression (PSD) is one of the most common and devastating neuropsychiatric complications in stroke patients, affecting more than one-third of survivors of ischemic stroke (IS). Despite its high incidence, PSD is often overlooked or undertreated in clinical practice, and effective preventive measures and therapeutic interventions remain limited. Although the exact mechanisms of PSD are not fully understood, emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays a key role in regulating gut-brain communication. This has sparked great interest in the relationship between the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) and PSD, especially in the context of cerebral ischemia. In addition to the gut microbiota, another important factor is the gut barrier, which acts as a frontline sensor distinguishing between beneficial and harmful microbes, regulating inflammatory responses and immunomodulation. Based on this, this paper proposes a new approach, the microbiota-immune-barrier axis, which is not only closely related to the pathophysiology of IS but may also play a critical role in the occurrence and progression of PSD. This review aims to systematically analyze how the gut microbiota affects the integrity and function of the barrier after IS through inflammatory responses and immunomodulation, leading to the production or exacerbation of depressive symptoms in the context of cerebral ischemia. In addition, we will explore existing technologies that can assess the MGBA and potential therapeutic strategies for PSD, with the hope of providing new insights for future research and clinical interventions."

Anti-ganglioside antibodies are thought to play a key role in the clinical diversity of the disease and can be helpful in clinical practice. Extensive research into clinical associations of individual anti-ganglioside antibody specificities has been performed. Recent research has highlighted glycolipid complexes, glycolipid combinations that may alter antibody binding, as targets. In this study, we investigated antibody reactivity patterns to glycolipids and glycolipid complexes using combinatorial array, in relation to clinical features in Guillain-Barré syndrome. In total, 1413 patients from the observational International Guillain-Barré syndrome Outcome Study (0-91 years, 60.3% male) and 1061 controls (healthy, family, infectious, vaccination, other neurological disease) were included. Acute-phase sera from patients were screened for IgM, IgG, and IgA reactivity against 15 glycolipids and one phospholipid and their heteromeric complexes, similarly to archived control sera. Antibody specificities and reactivity patterns were analysed in relation to clinical features. Of all patients, 1309 (92.6%) were positive for at least one anti-glycolipid (complex) antibody. Anti-GM1 and anti-GQ1b (complex) antibodies best distinguished motor Guillain-Barré syndrome and Miller Fisher syndrome from controls, with antibodies to glycolipid complexes outperforming antibodies to single glycolipids. Three models consisting of anti-glycolipid (complex) antibodies distinguished patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, the motor variant, and Miller Fisher syndrome from controls with high sensitivity and specificity, performing better than antibodies to single glycolipids used in clinical practice. Seven patient clusters with particular antibody reactivity patterns were identified. These clusters were distinguished by geographical region, clinical variants, preceding Campylobacter jejuni infection, electrophysiological subtypes, the Medical Research Council sum score at study entry, and the ability to walk 10 meters unaided at 26 weeks. Two patient clusters with distinct anti-GM1 (complex) reactivity (broad versus restricted) differed in frequency of the axonal subtype. In cumulative incidence analyses, 15 anti-glycolipid (complex) antibodies were associated with the time required to regain the ability to walk 10 meters unaided. After adjustment for known prognostic factors, IgG anti-GQ1b:GM4, GQ1b:PS, and GQ1b:Sulphatide remained associated with faster recovery. Addition of anti-glycolipid antibodies to clinical prognostic models slightly improved their discriminative capacity, though insufficiently to improve the models. Measurement of anti-glycolipid antibodies by combinatorial array increases the diagnostic yield compared to assaying single glycolipids, identifies clinically relevant antibody reactivity patterns to glycolipids and glycolipid complexes, and may be useful in outcome prediction in Guillain-Barré syndrome."

This review critically evaluates the evidence on the underlying pain mechanisms in IBS-C and/or FC and explores management strategies, their limitations, and future directions.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Most research on constipation-related pain is based on IBS-C patients or animal models, with limited studies focusing on FC. Visceral hypersensitivity, serotonin dysregulation, gut-brain axis dysfunction, and central/peripheral nervous system alterations are implicated in IBS-C pain, while FC pain is less studied and may be primarily linked to colonic distension and motility dysfunction. Management strategies include 5-HT4 agonists, GC-C agonists, chloride channel activators, psychological therapies, probiotics and complementary medicine. Despite available treatment options, managing abdominal pain in IBS-C and FC remains challenging due to heterogeneous pathophysiology and limited targeted therapies. While some interventions provide symptomatic relief, there is no universally effective treatment for abdominal pain across all patients. Future research should focus on identifying pain-specific biomarkers, refining diagnostic criteria, and integrating multi-omics data and neuroimaging techniques to better distinguish pain mechanisms in IBS-C versus FC and develop more precise, patient-centered interventions."

Prolonged and inappropriate alcohol consumption, by affecting the gut microbiota and gut mucosa permeability, is thought to contribute to the development of behavioral and cognitive impairments, leading to Alcohol-Related Liver Disorders and potentially progressing into alcoholic cirrhosis, which is often associated with severe cognitive impairment related to neurodegeneration, such as hepatic encephalopathy and alcoholic dementia. The critical role of the gut microbiota is further supported by the efficacy of FDA-approved treatments for hepatic encephalopathy in alcoholic cirrhosis (i.e., lactulose and rifaximin). To stimulate new research, we hypothesize that interactions between a maladaptive stress response and a constitutional predisposition to neurodegeneration underlie the progression of AUD to conditions of Alcohol-Related Clinical Concerns with severe cognitive impairment, which represent a significant and costly burden to society. Early identification of AUD individuals at risk for developing these conditions could help to prioritize integrated therapeutic interventions targeting different substrates of the Gut Microbiome-Liver-Brain axis. Specifically, addiction medications, microbiome modulators, stress-reducing interventions, and, possibly soon, novel agents that reduce hepatic steatosis/fibrosis will be discussed in the context of digitally supported integrated therapeutic approaches. The explicit goal of this AUD treatment performed on the early stage of the disorder would be to reduce the transition from AUD to those conditions of Alcohol-Related Common Clinical Concerns associated with severe cognitive impairment, a strategy recommended for most neurological neurodegenerative disorders."

        "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern that promotes health and cognitive improvement through periodic fasting and eating. It has been shown to enhance neuroplasticity and reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. Recent studies have demonstrated that probiotic supplementation enhances cognitive performance by modulating gut microbiota composition and increasing short-chain fatty acid production, which in turn promotes neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) is the communication bridge between gut microbiota and the brain, influencing cognitive function through the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems. The combination of probiotics and IF may exert complementary effects on cognitive function, with IF enhancing gut microbial diversity and metabolic efficiency, while probiotics further modulate gut barrier integrity and neurotransmitter synthesis. This review critically examines the interplay between probiotics and IF on cognitive function via the MGBA, identifying key mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies that remain underexplored in current research."

Recent studies have shown the connection between inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and neurological disorders, revealing a bidirectional relationship through the gut-brain axis. Immunotherapies, such as Treg cells infusion, have been proposed for IBD. However, the role of adaptive immune cells in IBD-induced neuroinflammation remains unclear. In this study, we established an animal model for IBD in mice with severe combined immune-deficient (SCID), an adaptive immune deficiency, to investigate the role of adaptive immune cells in IBD-induced neuroinflammation. Mice were fed 1%, 3%, or 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 5 days. We measured body weight, colon length, disease activity index (DAI), and crypt damage. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured in the colon, while microglial morphology, neuronal count, and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in the brain. In the 3% DSS group, colitis symptoms appeared at day 7, with reduced colon length and increased crypt damage showing colitis-like symptoms. By day 21, colon length and crypt damage persisted, while DAI showed recovery. Although colonic inflammation peaked at day 7, no significant increase in inflammatory cytokines or microglial hyperactivation was observed in the brain. By day 21, neuroinflammation was detected, albeit with a slight delay, in the absence of adaptive immune cells. The colitis-induced neuroinflammation model provides insights into the fundamental immune mechanisms of the gut-brain axis and may contribute to developing immune cell therapies for IBD-induced neuroinflammation."

In this study, the effects of high prenatal corticosterone exposure on gene expression in the brain and small intestine of rat offspring were investigated via RNA-sequencing analysis. Pregnant rats were divided into two groups: Corti.Moms were injected with corticosterone daily, while Nor.Moms were given saline injections. Their offspring were labeled as Corti.Pups and Nor.Pups, respectively. The brain tissue analysis of Corti.Pups showed that the expression levels of the genes linked to neurodegenerative conditions increased and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, possibly due to higher ATP demands. The genes associated with calcium signaling pathways, neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, and IgA production were also upregulated in the small intestine of Corti.pups. Conversely, the genes related to protein digestion, absorption, and serotonergic and dopaminergic synaptic activities were downregulated. These findings revealed that gene expression patterns in both the brain and intestinal smooth muscle of offspring prenatally exposed to corticosterone were substantially altered. Thus, this study provided valuable insights into the effects of prenatal stress on neurodevelopment and gut function."

The results indicate that CUMS-induced mice exhibited significant depressive-like behaviors. Specifically, they displayed reduced sucrose intake in the sucrose preference test, decreased central area distance and time in the open field test, and reduced percentage of entries and time spent in the open arm in the elevated plus maze test. Molecular biological analysis indicated that CUMS treatment significantly upregulated the levels of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ in the serum and hippocampus of mice. Through high-throughput sequencing and Pearson correlation analysis, it was found that the levels of inflammatory factors were significantly positively correlated with the expression of multiple inflammatory pathway genes, as well as the abundance of beneficial and harmful bacteria. Furthermore, the persistent changes in inflammatory factors ultimately led to neuronal cell death. This study provides strong evidence for the role of disrupted \"microbiota-gut-brain\" axis homeostasis in the pathogenesis of CUMS-induced depression in mice. This finding offers a new perspective for understanding the pathological mechanisms of depression and provides strategies for future depression treatment."

Behavioral monitoring, immunofluorescence, protein immunoblotting, and high-throughput sequencing were used to investigate the critical role of the gut microbiome in DBP-induced dysfunction of the zebrafish gut-brain axis. The results showed pronounced, sex-specific toxic effects of acute DBP exposure in adult zebrafish, with males experiencing more severe neurological damage, while females exhibited greater intestinal damage. DBP exposure caused marked anxiety behaviors in males and significant weight loss in females. Males showed reduced neuronal expression, while females exhibited increased intestinal permeability and lower levels of the tight junction protein (ZO-1). The Firmicutes/Bacteroidota (F/B) ratio decreased, indicating severe gut microbiota dysbiosis. Changes in the gut and fecal microbiota composition, along with PICRUSt2 functional predictions, suggest that female zebrafish experienced more severe metabolic disturbances than males. Analysis of key gene expression in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) pathway revealed that changes in the abundance of tryptophan-metabolizing bacteria in the gut may explain the sex-specific effects of DBP on neurotransmitter serotonin levels in the brain, which influence the gut-brain axis in zebrafish. This study contributes to the understanding of toxic effects of DBP on aquatic organisms and provides strong evidence for assessing its environmental risks."

It functions autonomously while maintaining close communication with the central nervous system (CNS) via the gut-brain axis (GBA). ENS dysfunction plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. Disruptions such as altered neurotransmission, gut microbiota imbalance, and neuroinflammation contribute to disease pathogenesis. The GBA enables bidirectional communication through the vagus nerve, gut hormones, immune signaling, and microbial metabolites, linking gut health to neurological function. ENS dysregulation is implicated in conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), influencing systemic and CNS pathology through neuroinflammation and impaired barrier integrity. This review highlights emerging therapeutic strategies targeting ENS dysfunction, including prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and vagus nerve stimulation, which offer novel ways to modulate gut-brain interactions. Unlike previous perspectives that view the ENS as a passive disease marker, this review repositions it as an active driver of neurological disorders. By integrating advances in ENS biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and GBA modulation, this article presents a paradigm shift-emphasizing ENS dysfunction as a fundamental mechanism in neurodegeneration and neurodevelopmental disorders. This perspective paves the way for innovative diagnostics, personalized gut-targeted therapies, and a deeper understanding of the ENS's role in brain health and disease."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most common reasons for medical visits. Patients with FD incur large direct and indirect expenditures and may have significant financial burdens that affect quality of life. Our study aimed to assess the effectiveness of meditation as an adjuvant to the standard treatment in individuals diagnosed with FD. This will explore more cost-effective therapeutic management in diseases like FD, which is believed to be related to the gut-brain axis. Meditation is a nonpharmacological therapy, safer and economical, and its adjuvant use can minimize or avoid the adverse effects of long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA).\nOBJECTIVES: We wanted to comprehensively assess the role of meditation as an adjuvant therapy in patients with FD and compare it with the control arm receiving standard treatment alone. The primary objective was the change in gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) score, and the secondary objective was to assess the changes in the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) score and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) score before and after the intervention.\nMETHODS: Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were divided equally into two arms (experimental and control groups). The experimental group received standard treatment for dyspepsia (PPI, domperidone, TCAs) and Vaishvanara Agni meditation (VAM), while the control group received standard treatment alone. Both groups were compared at weeks 0, 4, and 8 in terms of change in GIQLI score, HADS (HADS-A and HADS-D score), and PSQI score.\nRESULTS: Our study showed that both groups experienced significant changes in GIQLI, HADS-A, HADS-D, and PSQI scores at 4 and 8 weeks when compared with the baseline time point. However, when both groups were directly compared, it was observed that the experimental group exhibited notable variations in the GIQLI score after 8 weeks, the HADS-D score after 8 weeks, and the PSQI score after 4 weeks when contrasted with the control group. These differences were found to be statistically significant.\nCONCLUSION: FD does not have an identified structural or biochemical cause, making it a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that requires a tailored treatment approach. Our pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated the impact of meditation as adjuvant therapy for FD, revealing improvements in GI health, mental well-being, and sleep quality compared to standard treatment alone. The study recommends incorporating meditation into the management of FD and similar conditions, highlighting its holistic nature that addresses not only specific symptoms but also overall well-being. This study pioneers the examination of meditation as a complementary approach for FD, offering promising results in improving GIQLI, HADS, and PSQI scores and thus adding value to preexisting literature."

This review aims to comprehensively examine the role of GBA post-traumatic brain injury (TBI).\nRECENT FINDINGS: The GBA functions through neural, metabolic, immune, and endocrine systems, creating bidirectional signaling pathways that modulate brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract physiology. TBI perturbs these signaling pathways, producing pathophysiological feedback loops in the GBA leading to dysbiosis (i.e., a perturbed gut microbiome, impaired brain-blood barrier, impaired intestinal epithelial barrier (i.e., \"leaky gut\"), and a maladaptive, systemic inflammatory response. Damage to the CNS associated with TBI leads to GI dysmotility, which promotes small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO has been associated with the early stages of neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Many of the bacteria associated with this overgrowth promote inflammation and, in rodent models, have been shown to compromise the structural integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, causing malabsorption of essential nutrients and further exacerbating dysbiosis. TBI-induced pathophysiology is strongly associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, which represents a significant public health burden and challenge for patients and their families. A healthy gut microbiome has been shown to promote improved recovery from TBI and prevent the development of neurodegenerative disease, as well as other chronic complications. The role of the gut microbiome in brain health post-TBI demonstrates the potential for microbiome-targeted interventions to mitigate TBI-associated comorbidities. Promising new evidence on prebiotics, probiotics, diet, and fecal microbiota transplantation may lead to new therapeutic options for improving the quality of life for patients with TBI. Still, many of these preliminary findings must be explored further in clinical settings. This review covers the current understanding of the GBA in the setting of TBI and how the gut microbiome may provide a novel therapeutic target for treatment in this patient population."

There has been a suggested connection between the microbiome and many neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. This has been explored in human and animal studies. While no microbial biomarkers have been identified yet, alterations in several taxa have been suggested to be associated with disease states. The potential of the microbiome to modulate neurological function has sparked multiple clinical trials using gut-altering treatments, some with positive preliminary results."

The causes of cognitive decline in these patients are likely to be multifactorial, including vascular disease, uraemic toxins, blood-brain barrier leakage, and metabolic and endocrine changes. Gut dysbiosis is common in patients with CKD and contributes to the increase in uraemic toxins. However, the gut microbiome modulates local and systemic levels of several metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids or derivatives of tryptophan metabolism, neurotransmitters, endocannabinoid-like mediators, bile acids, hormones such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) or cholecystokinin (CCK). These factors can affect gut function, immunity, autonomic nervous system activity and various aspects of brain function. Key areas include blood-brain barrier integrity, nerve myelination and survival/proliferation, appetite, metabolism and thermoregulation, mood, anxiety and depression, stress and local inflammation. Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and the production of biologically active metabolites in patients with CKD are well documented and are favoured by low-fiber diets, elevated urea levels, sedentary lifestyles, slow stool transit times and polypharmacy. In turn, dysbiosis can modulate brain function and cognitive processes, as discussed in this review. Thus, the gut microbiome may contribute to alterations in cognition in patients with CKD and may be a target for therapeutic interventions using diet, prebiotics and probiotics."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gut-brain axis, i.e. the bidirectional communication system between the gut and the brain, has become of central importance in Parkinson disease (PD) research over the past 20 years.\nAIMS: We aimed to describe the milestones of the gut-brain axis research in PD and the development of theories proposing the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract in PD pathogenesis.\nMETHODS: We searched PubMed using the terms 'gut-brain axis' AND 'Parkinson disease', and selected relevant articles to provide the foundation for reconstructing an historical overview of the gut-brain axis research in PD.\nRESULTS: Mounting evidence from preclinical, clinical and post-mortem studies suggests that a subgroup of PD patients present with a range of prodromal symptoms (e.g., autonomic dysfunction, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder) which reflect initial accumulation and later spread of pathological α-synuclein rostrally from the gastrointestinal tract (\"body-first\" PD). Through neural connections along the gut-brain axis, pathological α-synuclein may spread to the brain, producing clinically manifest disease. Recently, two mechanisms involving the gut-brain axis have attracted increasing attention for their role in PD pathogenesis and progression, namely the perturbation of the composition of the microorganisms living in the gut (the gut microbiome), and the dysfunction of enteroendocrine cells.\nCONCLUSION: Treatments targeting the gut-brain axis, especially the gut microbiome and the enteroendocrine cells pathway, could potentially slow disease progression or even prevent disease onset. Among these, pre/probiotics, faecal microbiota transplantation, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, have entered advanced stages of clinical trials in humans and shown potential symptomatic and disease-modifying effects."

Dysbiosis, an imbalance in microbial composition, has been linked to a range of GI disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), celiac disease, and colorectal cancer. These conditions are influenced by the interactions between the gut microbiota, the host immune system, and the gut-brain axis. Recent research has highlighted the potential for microbiome-based therapeutic strategies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and dietary modifications, to restore microbial balance and alleviate disease symptoms. This review examines the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of common gastrointestinal diseases and explores emerging therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating the microbiome. We discuss the scientific foundations of these interventions, their clinical effectiveness, and the challenges in their implementation. The review underscores the therapeutic potential of microbiome-targeted treatments as a novel approach to managing GI disorders, offering personalized and alternative options to conventional therapies.

We found that psychobiotics can significantly reduce symptoms of various psychiatric disorders by influencing neurotransmitter levels, regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and improving gut barrier function through short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other metabolites. However, several limitations were identified, including inconsistent study methodologies, small sample sizes, and a lack of data on long-term safety. Addressing these limitations through rigorous research is essential for establishing standardized protocols and fully confirming the therapeutic potential of psychobiotics.

Emerging research highlights the critical role of the gut microbiota in regulating CNS health and disease. The composition of the gut microbiota is essential for maintaining CNS homeostasis, as it modulates immune responses, oxidative status, and neuroinflammation. The microbiota-gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network, plays a pivotal role in cancer and CNS disease treatment, exerting its influence through neural, endocrine, immunological, and metabolic pathways. Recent studies suggest that the gut microbiota influences the solidification of the tumor microenvironment and that dysbiosis may promote glioma development by modulating systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, which contributes to tumorigenesis and CNS tumor progression. This review interrogates the impact of the gut microbiota on glioma, focusing on critical pathways such as NF-κB, MAPK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and Kynurenine/AhR that drive tumor proliferation, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. Furthermore, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies, including probiotics and microbiota-based interventions, which show potential in modulating these pathways and enhancing immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors.

Participants were assessed for vagally-mediated HRV, daily salivary cortisol levels, psychometric characteristics, and gut microbiota composition. Using a categorical approach based on the median split of HRV and cortisol values, we identified an association between low vagally-mediated HRV, greater depressive symptomatology, and altered gut microbiota (e.g., a higher abundance of Prevotella and a smaller abundance of Faecalibacterium, Alistipes, and Gemmiger). This suggests that vagally-mediated HRV may be a useful biomarker of microbiota-gut brain axis function, and that low vagally-mediated HRV may play an important role in the bidirectional link between gut dysbiosis and depression. On the other hand, daily cortisol parameters (e.g., cortisol awakening response, diurnal cortisol slope) were associated either with higher anxiety and perceived stress, or with a specific gut microbiota profile.

Recent research has revealed the intricate interaction between the brain and gut microbiota through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) and its effect on neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). Alterations in the gut microbiota, known as gut dysbiosis, are linked to the development and progression of several NDDs. Studies suggest that the gut microbiota may be a viable target for improving cognitive health and reducing hallmarks of brain aging. Numerous pathways including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stimulation, neurotransmitter release disruption, system-wide inflammation, and increased intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability connect gut dysbiosis to neurological conditions. Metabolites produced by the gut microbiota influence neural processes that affect brain function. Clinical interventions depend on the capacity to understand the equilibrium between beneficial and detrimental gut microbiota, as it affects both neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. The importance of the gut microbiota and its metabolites during brain aging and the development of neurological disorders is summarized in this review. Moreover, we explored the possible therapeutic effects of the gut microbiota on age-related NDDs. Highlighting various pathways that connect the gut and the brain, this review identifies several important domains where gut microbiota-based interventions could offer possible solutions for age-related NDDs. Furthermore, prebiotics and probiotics are discussed as effective alternatives for mitigating indirect causes of gut dysbiosis.

Previously, our group bred a novel dwarf chicken strain with frizzled feather, named as dwarf chicken with frizzled feather (DFC). The cumulative growth of the chicken body weight and size were analyzed with 3 mathematical models. Subsequently, chickens were grouped to investigate the impact of heat stress (HS) on their slaughter performance, histomorphological development and gene mRNA change (HSP70, muscle development and appetite-related factors) using quantitative real-time PCR, tissue sections and Western Blot. In the HS group, chickens were placed at 34 ± 1°C for 8 hours (9:00 am - 17:00 pm) a day and lasted for 2 weeks, while in the control group, chickens were fed at 26 ± 1°C. Chicken tissue samples were collected at the age of 120 days to evaluate production performance, histological changes, and gene expression changes. Our results found that the Gompertz model was the best for fitting the body weight of DFC. The integrity of muscle, liver, spleen, and small intestine tissues was affected under HS conditions. Correspondingly, the length of the ileum was significantly decreased (P < 0.05), the thigh muscle development factor MYOD1 expression was down-regulated (P < 0.05), while the expression of MSTN was up-regulated (P < 0.001). In addition, the jejunum VH / CD was reduced significantly (P < 0.05). The mRNA of appetite-promoting factors AMPKα-1 and AGRP in the gut-brain axis were down-regulated (P < 0.05), while appetite-restrain factors CCK, GHRL, and CART were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).

A growing body of research highlights the influence of tryptophan and its metabolites, such as serotonin, beyond their traditional roles in neural signaling. Serotonin acts as a key neurotransmitter within the brain-gut-microbiome axis, a critical bidirectional communication network affecting both metabolism and behavior. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiome regulates brain function and behavior, particularly through microbial influences on tryptophan metabolism and the serotonergic system, both of which are essential for normal functioning. Additionally, sex differences exist in multiple aspects of serotonin-mediated modulation within the brain-gut-microbiome axis, affecting feeding and affective behaviors. This review summarizes the current knowledge from human and animal studies on the influence of tryptophan and its metabolite serotonin on metabolic and behavioral regulation involving the brain and gut microbiome, with a focus on sex differences and the role of sex hormones. We speculate that gut-derived tryptophan and serotonin play essential roles in the pathophysiology that modifies neural circuits, potentially contributing to eating and affective disorders. We propose the gut microbiome as an appealing therapeutic target for metabolic and affective disorders, emphasizing the importance of understanding sex differences in metabolic and behavioral regulation influenced by the brain-gut-microbiome axis. The therapeutic targeting of the gut microbiota and its metabolites may offer a viable strategy for treating serotonin-related disorders, such as eating and affective disorders, with potential differences in treatment efficacy between men and women.

The V3-V4 region was sequenced using 16S rRNA quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) to compare the composition of gut microbiota and differences in abundance among the three experimental groups.\nRESULTS: The abundance and diversity of gut microbiota significantly increased in EAD patients compared to the healthy control group. Furthermore, 39 genera showed considerable variations between EAD and LAD patients and healthy controls, with notable increases in the abundance of Bryantella, Gemmiger, Desulfovibrio, Collinsella, and Odoribacter among EAD patients. Additionally, significant differences were observed across the Desulfovibrioales and Verrucomicrobiales, which could help distinguish EAD patients (Area Under the Curve (AUC) range 0.854, 0.966, p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: 16S rRNA technology can be used to identify EAD patients, with the Desulfovibrioales and Verrucomicrobiales indicators serving as potential biological markers."

        "abstract": "Diabetes-related cognitive dysfunction (DACD) is a comorbidity of type 2 diabetes that has a negative effect on patients' quality of life. Research has indicated that disruption of the gut microbiota (GM) may be linked to dementia with altered cognitive performance. Conversely, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) may reverse DACD. The present study aimed to assess the effects of an n-3 PUFA intervention and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on high-fat and streptozotocin-induced DACD model rats. In DACD rats, n-3 PUFA treatment restored fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels and cognitive function, increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the cortex and colon. Additionally, the expression of the postsynaptic density protein-95 mRNA and protein varied with n-3 PUFA treatment. Treatment with n-3 PUFAs also increased the expression of tight junction proteins. Beneficial and short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria were more abundant when rats were exposed to n-3 PUFAs. After FMT from the rats with DACD symptoms that were improved by the n-3 PUFA dietary intervention into another batch of DACD rats, we observed recovery in recipient DACD rats. These results indicated that the alleviation of DACD symptoms by n-3 PUFAs was attributed to gut microbiota remodeling."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke is a multifaceted physiological event linked to imbalances in gut microbiota and disruptions in metabolic pathways. Traditional Chinese medicines, leveraging the gut-brain axis, have been shown to significantly ameliorate ischemic stroke. However, the specific role and molecular mechanism of Shenqi granules (SQF) in enhancing the recovery from ischemic stroke remain to be elucidated.\nPURPOSE: This study aims to explore the therapeutic effects of SQF on rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) and its regulatory effects on the gut microbiota, providing a basis for the clinical rational use of drugs in ischemic stroke.\nMETHODS: The study conducted a comprehensive biological assessment of SQF's role in improving CIRI at the whole-animal level. Subsequently, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and network pharmacology analysis were used for component analysis and target prediction. Then, the therapeutic targets of SQF were further validated through molecular docking and molecular experiments. Finally, an integrated omics approach combining fecal untargeted metabolome and 16S rRNA sequencing was employed to state the anti-CIRI effects of SQF and its potential mechanisms.\nRESULTS: SQF alleviates cerebral infarct volume and improves cognitive functions in MCAO rats. Network pharmacology analysis shows 20 potential active ingredients of SQF could target 13 target proteins. Further employing WGCNA, our study identified four key targets of SQF in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Based on molecular docking and molecular experiments, SQF improves CIRI by activating NFE2L2/NRF2. Serum metabolomics analysis identified six metabolites related to the tryptophan and tyrosine metabolic pathways, which interact with NFE2L2/NRF2 protein. Fecal metabolome and microbiome reveal that SQF's protective effect on CIRI is linked to the tryptophan metabolism and tyrosine metabolism and gut microbiome modulation. In particular, metabolites related to tryptophan and tyrosine metabolism, such as kynurenic acid and dopamine, may exert their protective effects by interacting with NFE2L2/NRF2.\nCONCLUSION: This pioneering study unveils the therapeutic potential of SQF in addressing CIRI, highlighting the pivotal role of NFE2L2/NRF2 upregulation in its mechanism of action. Furthermore, SQF demonstrates its efficacy in restoring gut microbiota balance by modulating the metabolism of tryptophan and tyrosine in CIRI. By elucidating the intricate interplay among constituents, targets, metabolites, and gut microbiota, this research offers novel insights into the multifaceted mechanisms underlying SQF's therapeutic impact on CIRI."

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined as a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by a set of deficits not limited to social communication, which is restricted and repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of autism has been seen to be consistently increasing globally. Autism is multifactorial in its etiology, and it involves several physiological systems, including the central nervous system and the gut-brain axis. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for neural development and functionality, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). They both play a crucial role in not only reducing the neuroinflammation associated with autism but also supporting cognitive processing as well. Given the low levels of omega-3 noted in ASD individuals, this systematic review aims to assess the influence of omega-3 supplementation on cognitive outcomes in children with ASD. The systematic review was done following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, where different databases were assessed across PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Scopus. MeSH terms used included keywords \"Omega-3\", \"EPA\", \"DHA\" AND \"Autism Spectrum Disorder\" OR \"ASD\". Articles published between 2007 and 2023 that focused on ages 2 to 18 years were screened, and cognitive outcomes relevant to omega-3 supplementation were included. Studies with inadequate access to full text excluded non-human trials and older individuals. After generating 25,312 articles, 211 were selected for further review, with 11 meeting the inclusion criteria. The articles reviewed panned over five different countries that involved omega-3 supplementation lasting up to one year. Results suggested that DHA and EPA supplementation may improve cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and executive functioning in children with ASD. The prefrontal cortex development was associated with DHA supplementation, whereas EPA showed improved emotional regulation and reduced neuroinflammation. However, conclusive results were not reached as there was variability in study designs, different dosages, and assessment methods. The power of the studies conducted was also noted to be limited. While promising, extensive research and trials are required to standardize the dosage of omega-3 and the length of intervention. Future studies should aim to identify the long-term effects of omega-3 supplementation, understand the gut-brain axis, and investigate the combination of omega-3 with other therapies to improve cognitive functioning."

It has also been associated with gut abnormalities, such as with irritable bowel syndrome, indicating possible involvement of the gut microbiome and gut-brain axis. Whereas previous research has implicated the gut microbiome and microbiome gut-brain axis in various mental health disorders, the relationship between gut microbiome function and PTSD is unclear. Specifically, little is known about whether specific gut microbiome compositions can increase the risk of developing PTSD, or, vice versa, act as a protective factor for the individual. This systematic review aims to synthesize the literature looking at gut microbiome differences between individuals with PTSD and trauma-exposed controls (TEC) while exploring potential risk and resilience factors for development of the disorder. Three studies met the inclusion criteria, and results showed that all studies found differences in gut microbial taxa between PTSD and TEC groups yet varied in their taxonomic level and type. One study found a significant difference in diversity between groups, reporting lower diversity in PTSD, and two studies found certain taxa to be correlated with PTSD symptom severity:"

Its pathogenesis is closely associated with the intestinal flora. This study aimed to explore the enterotypes in AD by identifying key bacteria through machine learning and species co-occurrence network analysis.\nMETHODS: The collection of fecal samples from AD patients was followed by 16 S rRNA analysis using QIIME2. Enterotype clustering was conducted at the genus level, and deep neural network (DNN) classification models were developed for AD and healthy controls within each enterotype.\nRESULTS: Analysis of three 16 S rRNA gut microbiome datasets identified three distinct enterotypes: Escherichia_Shigella (ET-E), Faecalibacterium (ET-F), and Bacteroides (ET-B). The ET-E is mainly characterized by the absence of Akkermansia in AD group. The Akkermansia was significantly positively correlated with Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group and negatively correlated with biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism. The ET-F highly expressed Agathobacter, un_f__Lachnospiraceae, Lachnoclostridium, and low expressed Dorea in AD group. Among them, Agathobacter was significantly positively correlated with un_f__Lachnospiraceae, and un_f__Lachnospiraceae was significantly positively correlated with Lachnoclostridium. The Dorea was significantly negatively correlated with Lachnoclostridium. The AD from ET-B group had high expression of two beneficial bacteria, Butyricicoccus and Parabacteroides. The findings suggest that the ET-E enterotype may predispose individuals to AD, with Akkermansia identified as a potential risk factor. Conversely, the ET-B enterotype appears to be associated with milder symptoms, with Butyricicoccus and Parabacteroides potentially serving as protective factors. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the species characteristics and interactions within different enterotypes is essential for modulating the gut-brain axis and mitigating AD symptoms."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For the past two decades there has been a growing appreciation of the role that the microbiota (the trillions of microorganisms within and on our bodies) plays as one of the key regulators of gut-brain function and has led to the appreciation of the importance of a distinct microbiota-gut-brain axis across the lifespan but especially during neurodevelopment.\nSUMMARY: The gut microbiota and its relevant metabolites interact with the immune and the central nervous systems during critical temporal windows of development. These critical developmental windows perinatally (during the first 1000 days) are susceptible timepoints for insults that can endure long-lasting effects on the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Accumulating evidence shows that a variety of factors can impact the microbiota in early life including mode of birth delivery, antibiotic exposure, mode of nutritional provision, infection, stress as well as host genetics. Additionally, sex differences occur in response to microbial manipulations in early life although the underlying mechanisms underpinning such effects remains elusive. Animal models have been essential in delineating a role of the microbiome in neurodevelopmental disorders ranging from autism spectrum disorder to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This mechanistic perspective should be supplemented with more translational studies to evaluate the applicability of findings from animal models to human subjects.\nKEY MESSAGES: Studies examining the translation of these effects from animal models to humans are currently ongoing with evidence for microbial modulation of neurocognitive development and neurodevelopmental risk increasing."

Here, using a forced loss paradigm to demote dominant mice to subordinate ranks, we find that stress alters the composition and function of the gut microbiota, increasing Muribaculaceae abundance and enhancing butanoate metabolism, and gut microbial depletion resists forced loss-induced hierarchical demotion and behavioral alteration. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) indicates that social status loss primarily affected interneurons, altering GABAergic synaptic transmission. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) reveals modules linked to forced loss in the gut microbiota, colon, PFC, and PFC interneurons, suggesting changes in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the glutamatergic synapse.

Mechanistic analyses revealed that nitenpyram disrupted brain metabolism via the intestinal MAPK pathway, reducing ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. Prophylactic Gilliamella treatment reversed these effects, restored metabolic balance, and modulated esterase E4 expression, enhancing pesticide resistance. This study underscores Gilliamella's vital role in honey bee resilience to neonicotinoids, offering insights into the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) as a pathway for enhancing pesticide tolerance and ecological health."

The immune system represents a key pathway of communication along this axis with the microbiome implicated in neuroinflammation in health and disease. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms as to how the gut microbiota interacts with the brain, focusing on innate and adaptive immunity that are often disrupted in gut-brain axis disorders. We also consider the implications of these observations and how they can be advanced by interdisciplinary research. Leveraging an increased understanding of how these interactions regulate immunity has the potential to usher in a new era of precision neuropsychiatric clinical interventions for psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurological disorders."

This research focused on examining the impact of XNJT for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (MCAO/R) injury, utilizing gut microbiota and metabolomic studies.\nMETHODS: The primary components of XNJT were identified through the application of the HPLC technique. We established a MCAO/ R model in mice and conducted behavioral evaluations, cerebral blood flow measurements, and TTC staining. We used ELISA, high-throughput 16S rDNA gene sequencing, and metabolomics techniques to detect inflammatory factors, microbial populations, and metabolites, respectively. Finally, we performed Spearman correlation analysis to investigate the relationships among gut microbiota and metabolites, comprehensively exploring the mechanisms of XNJT to alleviate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.\nRESULTS: We discovered that XNJT effectively enhanced neurological performance, alleviated cerebral infarction, diminished neuronal cell death, and increased cerebral blood flow. Moreover, XNJT downregulated the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF, IL-6, and IL-1b. Additionally, XNJT improved gut microbiota levels in MCAO/R mice, particularly\nDISCUSSION: In summary, our findings suggest that XNJT can improve cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury outcomes, reduce inflammatory responses, and regulate gut microbiota and differential metabolites.

        "abstract": "The gut microbiota has co-evolved with its host, profoundly shaping the development and functioning of the immune system. This co-evolution has led to a dynamic relationship where microbial metabolites and molecular signals influence immune maturation, tolerance, and defense mechanisms, highlighting its essential role in maintaining host health. Recently, bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs), membrane nanoparticles produced by bacteria, have emerged as important players in gut balance and as potent immune modulators. These vesicles reflect the characteristics of the bacterial membrane and contain nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and metabolites. They can regulate immune processes and are involved in neurological and metabolic diseases due to their ability to distribute both locally in the gut and systemically, affecting immune responses at both levels. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the characteristics and functional profile of BEVs, detailing how nutrition influences the production and function of these vesicles, how antibiotics can disrupt or alter their composition, and how these factors collectively impact immunity and disease development. It also highlights the potential of BEVs in the development of precision nutritional strategies through dietary modulation, such as incorporating prebiotic fibers to enhance beneficial BEV production, reducing intake of processed foods that may promote harmful BEVs, and tailoring probiotic interventions to influence specific microbial communities and their vesicular outputs."

Current research highlights the critical role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in regulating gut microbiota diversity, vascular function, and homeostasis within the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 is utilized by the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter host cells, but its downregulation following infection contributes to gut microbiota dysbiosis and RAS disruption. These imbalances have been linked to a range of long COVID symptoms, including joint pain, chest pain, chronic cough, fatigue, brain fog, anxiety, depression, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, memory difficulties, and impaired attention. This review investigates the dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and the long-term effects it has on various organ systems, including the musculoskeletal, neurological, renal, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. We explored the bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota, immune function, and these organ systems, focusing on how microbiota dysregulation contributes to the chronic inflammation and dysfunction observed in long COVID symptoms. Understanding these interactions is key for identifying effective therapeutic strategies and interventional targets aimed at mitigating the impact of long COVID on organ health and improving patient outcomes."

However, the cellular mechanism by which E. coli K1 may cause neuropathies is not well understood due to the lack of relevant human multi-organ models for studying multifaceted systemic inflammation across the gut-brain axis. Here, we reconstruct a multicellular model of the human gut-brain axis to identify the neuropathogenic mechanism driven by E. coli K1-colibactin meningitis. We observed that E. coli K1-genotoxic colibactin induced intestinal and peripheral interleukin 6, causing the blood-brain barrier injury and endothelial inflammation via the p38/p65 pathways. Serpin-E1 from the damaged cerebral endothelia induces reactive astrocytes to release IFN-γ, which reduces microglial phagocytosis of E. coli K1 and exacerbates detrimental neuroinflammation via NLRP3/IL-18 axis. Microglial IL-18 elevates neuronal reactive oxidative stress that worsens DNA double-strand breaks in E. coli K1-infected neurons, leading to H3K4 trimethylation and phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein. Our findings suggest therapeutic strategies for post-bacterial meningitis treatment to potentially prevent the initiation of synucleinopathy."

Existing literature suggests a physical link between psychiatric diagnoses and disorders of the gut-brain interaction at intestinal mast cells (MC) via corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and its intestinally located receptors (CRHR1/CRHR2). Our study aimed to further clarify the physiologic connection between pediatric psychiatric illness and FD.\nMETHODS: Study subjects were identified and classified into three groups. The FD group met Rome IV criteria and had insignificant gross endoscopic and histologic findings on gastric and duodenal biopsies. The control group reported no gastrointestinal symptoms or documented psychiatric illness. A third group consisted of Helicobacter pylori (HP)-positive dyspepsia patients independent of psychiatric history. Duodenal biopsy blocks were stained with antibodies targeting MCs, CRH, and CRHR1/CRHR2.\nRESULTS: We included 49 patients: 21 FD, nine controls, and 19 HP patients. We found a statistical difference between duodenal MC density in FD versus controls and HP versus controls (p < 0.05). We found no significant CRHR2 staining in the control group, yet the FD and HP groups yielded strong stains. We found a significant increase in MC density and CRHR2 staining in patients with a psychiatric history versus without (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Our data show increased MC density and stronger CRHR2 staining in patients with FD and in patients with a psychiatric history.

While the role of gut microbiota in depression has been extensively studied, the influence of the oral microbiome remains underexplored. Recent studies suggest that the oral microbiome may affect systemic and brain health through the oral-brain axis. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between oral microbiome diversity and depression using data from 6212 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2012.\nMETHODS: Oral microbiome diversity was assessed through oral rinse samples using 16S rRNA sequencing, focusing on α-diversity metrics (observed ASVs and Faith's phylogenetic diversity) and β-diversity measures. Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Weighted logistic regression models were employed to assess associations between α-diversity and depression, while linear regression was used to examine the relationship between α-diversity and PHQ-9 scores. β-diversity differences were analyzed via permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA).\nRESULTS: 10.03% of the participants were diagnosed with depression. Higher α-diversity in the oral microbiome was negatively correlated with depression: observed ASVs (OR: 0.713 [CI: 0.508-0.999], P = 0.050) and Faith's phylogenetic diversity (OR: 0.584 [CI: 0.367-0.931], P = 0.025). Linear regression indicated that greater α-diversity was associated with lower PHQ-9 scores, reflecting fewer depressive symptoms. Furthermore, β-diversity analysis revealed significant differences in the microbiome composition between depressed and non-depressed individuals.\nCONCLUSION: Reduced oral microbiome diversity is associated with an increased risk and severity of depression.

Supplementary analyses included sensitivity analyses, Steiger tests, and Bayesian weighted MR (BWMR). Mediation analyses used two-step MR (TSMR) and multivariable MR (MVMR).\nRESULTS: The analyses revealed 51 positive correlations (risk factors) (β > 0, P < 0.05) and 47 negative correlations (protective factors) (β < 0, P < 0.05) between gut microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, 35 positive correlations (β > 0, P < 0.05) and 22 negative correlations (β < 0, P < 0.05) between lipids and neuropsychiatric disorders were observed. Assessment of reverse causality with the seven neuropsychiatric disorders as exposures and the identified gut microbiota and lipids as outcomes revealed no evidence of reverse causality (P > 0.05).

Studies included were those that assessed attention in adult IBS patients using valid measurement tools. A total of 24 studies were analyzed, incorporating neuroimaging and behavioral methods.\nRESULTS: IBS individuals exhibit specific attentional impairments, including deficits in sustained attention, selective attentional biases toward gastrointestinal (GI)-related and symptom-specific stimuli, and heightened vigilance to threat and pain cues. Neurofunctional studies reveal altered brain activity in areas such as the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala, indicating increased interoceptive awareness and cognitive load. Pre-attentive processing and sensory gating show exaggerated responses, while sustained attention and attentional control demand additional cognitive resources. These patterns reflect an interplay between heightened sensitivity to internal stimuli and cognitive processing challenges in IBS.\nCONCLUSION: This review highlights specific attentional deficits and biases in IBS, suggesting they may contribute to symptom exacerbation and emotional distress.

Neural regulation of inflammation, gut innervation, and the brain-gut axis in critical illness are discussed.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies indicate that the brain-gut axis and the enteric nervous system are integral to the regulation of local and systemic inflammation. Experimental evidence suggests that neural reflexes control immune responses, and specific neural signals promote gastrointestinal homeostasis.

Notably, therapeutic interventions targeting neuro-immune pathways have shown promise in preclinical models, suggesting that a better understanding of the neuro-immune crosstalk in the critically ill may potentially identify novel therapeutic targets.\nSUMMARY: Critical illness involves complex organ dysfunction, not least in the gastrointestinal system. A multitude of neuroimmune interactions between the intestinal wall, immune cells, peripheral nerves and the central nervous system regulate inflammation. While experimental evidence supports the role of neural reflexes in controlling immune responses, clinical validation is lacking in the context of critical care.

PND is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and progression to neurodegenerative diseases, thus exerting significant financial strains on families as well as the healthcare system. Given that an ageing global population is an inevitable trend and, with the latest advances in the healthcare system, an ever-growing number of elderly people present for surgery and anesthesia, PND is of prominent concern. The two-way communication between the intestinal flora and the brain, also known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis, plays an important role in central nervous system development, and multiple studies have highlighted the influence exerted by gut microbiome in both health and disease. Pertinent studies have corroborated the fact that anesthesia and surgery disrupt the harmony of the gut ecology, which sets off a cascade of events that initiate neuroinflammation, eventually leading to PND. Probiotics, which are live microorganisms that promote the host's health, have been shown as a viable option to restore or minimise the disruption of gut flora. Evidence exists that probiotics exhibit immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory benefits. Given the effectiveness of probiotics in reducing neuroinflammation, research has also focused on their impact on the development of PND.

Five taxa, namely Prevotella (p = 0.037), Faecalibacterium (p = 0.032), Phascolarctobacterium (p = 0.002), Dialister (p = 0.043), and SMB53 (p = 0.012), were differentially abundant in cases compared to controls, but this observation did not survive correction for multiple testing. This exploratory study suggests a potential association between the relative abundance of Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Dialister, and SMB53 with SCZ case-control status. Given the lack of significance after correcting for multiple testing, these results should be interpreted with caution. Mechanistic studies in larger samples are warranted to confirm these findings and better understand the association between the gut microbiome and SCZ."

        "abstract": "While it is now accepted that the microbiome has strong impacts on animal growth promotion, the exact mechanism has remained elusive. Here we show that microbiome-emitted scents contain volatile somatotrophic factors (VSFs), which promote host growth in an olfaction-independent manner in Drosophila. We found that inhaled VSFs are readily sensed by olfactory receptor 42b non-neuronally expressed in subsets of tracheal airway cells, enteroendocrine cells, and enterocytes. Olfaction-independent sensing of VSFs activates the airway-gut-brain axis by regulating Hippo, FGF and insulin-like growth factor signaling pathways, which are required for airway branching, organ oxygenation and body growth. We found that a mutant microbiome that did not produce (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol failed to activate the airway-gut-brain axis for host growth. Importantly, forced inhalation of (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol completely reversed these defects. Our discovery of contact-independent and olfaction-independent airborne interactions between host and microbiome provides a novel perspective on the role of the airway-gut-brain axis in microbiome-controlled host development."

Icariside Ⅱ (ICS Ⅱ) is a naturally-occurring neuroprotectant with Sirt6 induction potency. However, it is unknown whether ICS Ⅱ protects against PSD through modulation of gut microbiota.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to reveal the effect and potential mechanisms of ICS Ⅱ on PSD, and the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis was investigated.\nMETHODS: Using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to establish post-stroke depression (PSD) mice, we assessed anti-depressant effects of ICS Ⅱ via behavioral tests, immunohistochemistry, and western blot. Transcriptome profiling, molecular docking, and surface plasmon resonance were used to identify key targets. 16S rDNA genomic-derived taxonomic profiling and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) were conducted to figure out the mechanistic role of the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).\nRESULTS: ICS Ⅱ ameliorated depressive-like behaviors in PSD mice as evidenced by sucrose preference test, forced swimming test and tail suspension test. ICS Ⅱ restored mitochondrial function, reduced oxidative damage and pro-inflammatory cytokines both in brain and intestine through regulation of Sirt6/NF-κB pathway. ICS Ⅱ significantly increased the abundance of gut microbiota (such asAkkermansia and Ligilactobacillus), enhanced SCFAs concentrations, repaired intestinal barrier integrity and upreglated the tight junction protein expression. FMT from ICS II-treated mice replicated these benefits, confirming gut microbiota's role. Mechanistically, ICS Ⅱ directly bound to Sirt6 and enhanced its activity. However, ICS Ⅱ-mediated neuroprotection was neutralized in PSD mice or hydrogen peroxide-induced enteric glial cells when Sirt6 was absent.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings expand the pharmacological properties of ICS II by demonstrating its ability to ameliorate PSD through modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. ICS Ⅱ, as a novel Sirt6 activator, could be translated into an alternative microbiota-targeted avenue for coping with PSD."

ClpB is known to induce α-MSH cross-reactive antibodies previously associated with eating disorders. In the present study we analyzed whether long-term changes of serum ClpB, anti-ClpB antibodies and fecal clpB gene content can be associated with disease progression in anorexia nervosa (AN). For this purpose, female adolescents diagnosed with the restrictive type of AN according to DSM-5 were studied at hospital admission, discharge, and at a 1-year follow up visit, while age-matched healthy female participants served as a control group. We found that ClpB protein was detected at variable levels in sera of all study participants without significant group differences. However, anti-ClpB IgG were low in adolescents with AN at the acute phase of disease and were characterized by increased affinity. Long-term individual dynamics of serum ClpB revealed that its increase after hospital discharge was associated with disease relapse. In healthy adolescents, serum ClpB correlated negatively with BMI-SDS. Fecal clpB DNA levels were low in patients at hospital admission and discharge correlating positively with the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in gut microbiota. Thus, in healthy adolescents enterobacterial ClpB appears as a physiological microbiota-derived factor associated with lower body weight within the normal range. Low levels of anti-ClpB IgG in adolescents with AN may cause insufficient immune control of ClpB, possibly promoting ClpB anorexigenic effects which can be relevant to the pathophysiology of AN."

These conditions affect not only the mental status but also the physical well-being of individuals, which leads to weakened immune systems and other diseases. Emerging research underscores a significant connection between the gut microbiome and neuropsychiatric diseases, suggesting that microbial communities within the gastrointestinal tract may influence brain function and mental health. Gut dysbiosis is caused by various factors, including stress, diet, inappropriate usage of antibiotics, infections, and so on, all of which can disrupt numerous pathways, resulting in abnormal neurotransmitter signaling, inflammation, and impaired brain function. Similarly, various neuropsychiatric diseases can disrupt the specific microbiome in the gut, leading to gut dysbiosis, often impairing memory and cognitive function. The growing evidence supporting the role of gut dysbiosis in neuropsychiatric disorders has opened up new avenues for therapeutic interventions. Modulating the gut microbiome through strategies such as probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation has shown promising results in various studies of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms involved in gut dysbiosis-associated brain changes to develop effective and personalized treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric diseases."

This relationship suggests a potential genetic overlap between these two conditions.\nMETHODS: We analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for both SCZ and constipation using a five-part approach. The first and second parts assessed the overall and local genetic correlations using methods such as linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and heritability estimation from summary statistics (HESS). The third part investigated the causal association between the two traits using Mendelian randomization (MR). The fourth part employed conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate (cond/conjFDR) to analyze the genetic overlap with different traits based on the statistical theory. Finally, an LDSC-specifically expressed gene (LDSC-SEG) analysis was conducted to explore the tissue-level associations.\nRESULTS: Our analyses revealed both overall and specific genetic correlations between SCZ and constipation at the genomic level. The MR analysis suggests a positive causal relationship between SCZ and constipation. The ConjFDR analysis confirms the genetic overlap between the two conditions and identifies two genetic risk loci (rs7583622 and rs842766) and seven mapped genes (GPR75-ASB3, ASB3, CHAC2, ERLEC1, GPR75, PSME4, and ACYP2). Further investigation into the functions of these genes could provide valuable insights. Interestingly, disease-related tissue analysis revealed associations between SCZ and constipation in eight brain regions (substantia nigra, anterior cingulate cortex, hypothalamus, cortex, hippocampus, cortex, amygdala, and spinal cord).\nCONCLUSION: This study provides the first genetic evidence for the comorbidity of SCZ and constipation, enhancing our understanding of the pathophysiology of both conditions."

Oral administration of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG; ATCC 53103) exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, although the precise mechanisms by which LGG benefits host physiology and behavior are not known. The goal of this study was to explore the general effects of LGG on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome and a biological signature of anti-inflammatory signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) of undisturbed, adult male rats.\nMETHODS: Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics were conducted using CSF samples collected after 21 days of oral treatment with live LGG (3.34 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in the drinking water (resulting in an estimated delivery of ∼1.17 × 109 CFU/day/rat) or water vehicle. Gene enrichment analysis (using DAVID, v. 6.8) and protein-protein interactions (using STRING, v. 11) were used to explore physiological network changes in CSF. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) was performed to assess gene expression changes of anti-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. Genes associated with anti-inflammatory signaling that were analyzed included Il10, Tgfb1, Il4, and IL-4-responsive genes, Cd200, Cd200r1, and Mrc1 (Cd206).\nRESULTS: Oral LGG administration altered the abundance of CSF proteins, increasing the abundance of five proteins (cochlin, NPTXR, reelin, Sez6l, and VPS13C) and decreasing the abundance of two proteins (CPQ, IGFBP-7) in the CSF. Simultaneously, LGG increased the expression of Il10 mRNA, encoding the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10, in the hippocampus.\nCONCLUSION: Oral LGG altered the abundance of CSF proteins associated with extracellular scaffolding, synaptic plasticity, and glutamatergic signaling. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that oral administration of LGG improves memory and cognition, and promotes a physiological resilience to neurodegenerative disease, by increasing glutamatergic signaling and promoting an anti-inflammatory environment in the brain."

In fact, up to 35 % of IBD patients also suffer from neuropsychiatric disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. Emerging research in this area indicates that in many cases these neuropsychiatric disorders are a secondary condition as a consequence of the disturbed communication between the gut and the brain via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of G-protein coupled receptor 109a (GPR109a), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), G-protein coupled receptor 43 (GPR43), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), soluble CD14 (sCD14), and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), while Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) were downregulated. These findings suggest that amisulpride may modulate acetate metabolism and immune signaling pathways in SCZ, potentially contributing to anti-inflammatory effects and neuroimmune regulation. The observed increase in acetate, a key microbial metabolite, and the altered expression of immune-related genes suggest a possible link between metabolic shifts and immunomodulatory responses in SCZ pathophysiology. However, direct evidence linking these changes to gut-brain axis mechanisms remains insufficient. Further research is needed to elucidate the therapeutic implications of these metabolic and immunological alterations and their potential role in symptom modulation."

Brain-targeted peptide (TGN: TGNYKALHPHNG) and DMY loaded chitosan (CS)/sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles (TGN-DMY-CS/TPP-NPs) and ovalbumin (OVA)/sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) nanoparticles (TGN-DMY-OVA/CMC-NPs) were prepared. TGN-DMY-CS/TPP-NPs demonstrated superior mucus penetration and BBB targeting ability compared to TGN-DMY-OVA/CMC-NPs, while the latter showed notable intestinal accumulation. TGN-DMY-CS/TPP-NPs treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of Alistipes and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, and TGN-DMY-OVA/CMC-NPs treatment obviously enhanced the relative abundance of Lactobacillus. Furthermore, both nanoparticles alleviated lipid metabolism disorder, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the liver, reduced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the brain, inhibited neuronal apoptosis, and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and synaptic plasticity in obesity-related AD mice. Despite different mucus penetration and biodistribution, their similar efficacy in improving obesity-related AD is attributed to the gut-brain bidirectional connection."

Female mice (6-week-old) were exposed daily for 7 weeks to peanut butter containing 0, 0.1, 1, or 6 mg/kg/day of PCBs. Twenty hours after the final exposure, the cecal content was collected to characterize the microbiome composition and predicted function. PCB and its metabolites in feces were analyzed using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), while cecal content was assessed with liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). PCB exposure influenced the abundance of microbial taxa and predicted functions within the cecal content. Complex PCB and metabolite mixtures were detected in the gastrointestinal tract. Network analysis revealed associations between specific parent PCBs and metabolites with changes in the abundance of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. These findings demonstrate that individual PCBs and their metabolites significantly influence the abundance of specific bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract following oral PCB exposure. These findings inform further research targeting the microbiome to attenuate the adverse health outcomes of PCB exposure."

        "year": "2025",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perinatal maternal stress, which includes both psychological and physiological stress experienced by healthy women during pregnancy and the postpartum period, is becoming increasingly prevalent. Infant early exposure to adverse environments such as perinatal stress has been shown to increase the long-term risk to metabolic, immunologic and neurobehavioral disorders. Evidence suggests that the human microbiome facilitates the transmission of maternal factors to infants via the vaginal, gut, and human milk microbiomes. The colonization of aberrant microorganisms in the mother's microbiome, influenced by the microbiome-brain-gut axis, may be transferred to infants during a critical early developmental period. This transfer may predispose infants to a more inflammatory-prone microbiome which is associated with dysregulated metabolic process leading to adverse health outcomes. Given the prevalence and potential impact of perinatal stress on maternal and infant health, with no systematic mapping or review of the data to date, the aim of this scoping review is to gather evidence on the relationship between perinatal maternal stress, and the human milk, maternal, and infant gut microbiomes.\nMETHODS: This is an exploratory mapping scoping review, guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology along with use of the Prisma Scr reporting guideline. A comprehensive search was conducted using the following databases, CINAHL Complete; MEDLINE; PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus with a protocol registered with Open Science Framework DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/5SRMV.\nRESULTS: After screening 1145 papers there were 7 paper that met the inclusion criteria. Statistically significant associations were found in five of the studies which identify higher abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Erwinia, Serratia, T mayombie, Bacteroides with higher maternal stress, and lower levels of stress linked to potentially beneficial bacteria such Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia. However, one study presents conflicting results where it was reported that higher maternal stress was linked to the prevalence of more beneficial bacteria.\nCONCLUSION: This review suggests that maternal stress does have an impact on the alteration of abundance and diversity of influential bacteria in the gut microbiome, however, it can affect colonisation in different ways. These bacterial changes have the capacity to influence long term health and disease. The review analyses data collection tools and methods, offers potential reasons for these findings as well as suggestions for future research."

        "abstract": "Lung injury can lead to specific neurocognitive dysfunction, and the \"triple-hit\" phenomenon may be the key theoretical mechanism for the progressive impairment of lung injury-related cognitive impairment. The lung and brain can communicate biologically through immune regulation pathway, hypoxic pathway, neural circuit, mitochondrial dysfunction, and microbial influence, which is called the \"lung-brain axis.\" The gut microbiota is a highly complex community of microorganisms that reside in the gut and communicate with the lung via the \"gut-lung axis.\" The dysregulation of gut microbiota may lead to the migration of pathogenic bacteria to the lung, and directly or indirectly regulate the lung immune response through their metabolites, which may cause or aggravate lung injury. The gut microbiota and the brain interact through the \"gut-brain axis.\" The gut microbiota can influence and regulate cognitive function and behavior of the brain through neural pathway mechanisms, immune regulation pathway and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation. Based on the gut microbiota regulation mechanism of the \"gut-lung axis\" and \"gut-brain axis,\" combined with the mechanisms of cognitive impairment caused by lung injury, we proposed the \"triple-hit\" hypothesis. It states that the pathophysiological changes of lung injury trigger a series of events such as immune disorder, inflammatory responses, and microbiota changes, which activate the \"lung-gut axis,\" thus forming a \"triple-hit\" that leads to the development or deterioration of cognitive impairment. This hypothesis provides a more comprehensive framework for studying and understanding brain dysfunction in the context of lung injury. This review proposes the existence of an interactive tandem network for information exchange among the gut, lung, and brain, referred to as the \"gut-lung-brain axis.\" It further explores the potential mechanism of lung injury-related cognitive impairment caused by multiple interactions of gut microbiota in the \"gut-lung-brain axis.\" We found that there are many numerous pathophysiological factors that influence the interaction within the \"gut-lung-brain axis.\" The impact of gut microbiota on cognitive functions related to lung injury may be mediated through mechanisms such as the \"triple-hit\" hypothesis, direct translocation of microbes and their metabolites, hypoxic pathway, immune modulation, vagal nerve activity, and the HPA axis regulation, among others. As the research deepens, based on the \"triple-hit\" hypothesis of lung injury, it is further discovered that gut microbial therapy can significantly change the pathogenesis of the inflammatory process on the \"gut-lung-brain axis.\" It can also relieve lung injury and therapeutically modulate brain function and behavior. This perspective provides a new idea for the follow-up treatment of lung injury-related cognitive impairment caused by dysregulation of gut microbiota."

Ongoing research shows promise for long-term solutions.\nSUMMARY: Studies highlight the dysregulation of Syt11 and α-synuclein (α-syn) in PD. Disrupted α-syn homeostasis due to palmitoylation of Syt11 contributes to its aggregation, potentially playing a role in PD pathology. α-synuclein aggregates in stool samples show promise as an early diagnostic biomarker. Vocal impairments in PD may be linked to α-syn-induced neuropathology. Irisin, produced after exercise, promotes the degradation of pathologic α-syn. Progress has been made in identifying PD biomarkers. Retinal thinning and abnormal protein aggregates in skin biopsies provide noninvasive diagnostic indicators. Blood-based biomarkers like α-syn, DJ-1, and LRRK2 hold promise but face limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) models enhance mitophagy, detect PD through sleep-breathing signals, and improve survival. AI analysis aids noninvasive assessment and risk prediction. Further understanding of PD involves studying pathological seeds and genetic mutations. Adenosine receptor regulation relates to early-onset PD, and specific gene mutations impact patient survival. Differentiated-induced pluripotent stem cells offer the potential for cell replacement therapy. Autoimmune features and T-cell involvement suggest intervention targets. Stem cell-based therapies and neurostimulation strategies show promise for improving motor function. Imaging reveals increased central inflammation in PD, suggesting an inflammatory role. Machine learning algorithms and home gait speed monitoring aid in diagnosis and disease progression tracking. Abnormal putamen gradients reflect dopaminergic loss and motor dysfunction. Antiepileptic drug prescriptions are associated with an increased PD risk. Personalized medicine, gut-brain axis involvement, and vestibular stimulation therapy offer potential PD treatment avenues. Genetic engineering techniques and deep brain stimulation show promise for alleviating PD symptoms.\nKEY MESSAGE: Ongoing research and technological advancements promise to improve PD screening, diagnosis, and treatment, bringing hope to affected individuals."

The gut-brain-microbiome axis, a communication pathway between the gut, brain and microorganisms, is emerging as a potential mechanism involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. While the gut microbiome's role in Alzheimer's disease has gained significant attention, the brain microbiome remains relatively unexplored. This review summarizes the latest research on the brain microbiome in Alzheimer's disease.\nRECENT FINDINGS: In the past 4 years, four out of five studies have found bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , in postmortem samples of both control and Alzheimer's disease brains, supporting the idea that the brain is not a sterile environment. Two studies report the overabundance of several bacterial phyla, including Proteobacteria and Actinomycetes, in postmortem Alzheimer's disease brains versus controls. One study reported the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi in a subset of Alzheimer's disease cases compared to controls.\nSUMMARY: Limitations and challenges persist in studying the brain microbiome, including the lack of standardized assays and data analysis methods, small sample sizes, and inconsistent use of controls for environmental microbial contamination during sample processing. Well designed studies that employ reproducible and rigorous methods are required to elucidate whether microbes are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."

        "abstract": "The brain-gut axis represents a bidirectional communication network that integrates neural, hormonal, and immunological signaling between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have increasingly been recognized for their profound impact on this axis, with implications for both mental and physical health outcomes. This mini-review explores the emerging field of epigenomics-specifically, how epigenetic modifications incurred by ACEs can influence the brain-gut axis and contribute to the pathophysiology of various disorders. We examine the evidence linking epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs to the modulation of gene expression involved in stress responses, neurodevelopment, and immune function-all of which intersect at the brain-gut axis. Additionally, we discuss the emerging potential of the gut microbiome as both a target and mediator of epigenetic changes, further influencing brain-gut communication in the context of ACEs. The methodological and therapeutic challenges posed by these insights are significant. The reversibility of epigenetic marks and the long-term consequences of early life stress require innovative and comprehensive approaches to intervention. This underscores the need for comprehensive strategies encompassing psychosocial, pharmacological, neuromodulation, and lifestyle interventions tailored to address ACEs' individualized and persistent effects. Future directions call for a multi-disciplinary approach and longitudinal studies to uncover the full extent of ACEs' impact on epigenetic regulation and the brain-gut axis, with the goal of developing targeted therapies to mitigate the long-lasting effects on health."

In the initial stages of this review, we will examine the way how MGBA affects neurogenesis, neuronal dendritic morphology, axonal myelination, microglia structure, brain blood barrier (BBB) structure and permeability, and synaptic structure. Furthermore, we will review the potential mechanistic pathways of neuroplasticity through MGBA influence. The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) play a pivotal role in the MGBA, where they can modify the BBB. We will therefore discuss how SCFAs can influence microglia, neuronal, and astrocyte function, as well as their role in brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Subsequently, we will examine the technical strategies employed to study MGBA interactions, including using germ-free (GF) animals, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and antibiotics-induced dysbiosis. Finally, we will examine how particular bacterial strains can affect brain structure and function. By gaining a deeper understanding of the MGBA, it may be possible to facilitate research into microbial-based pharmacological interventions and therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases."

A total of 100 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with prenatal depression were collected from various scientific publications and databases. Bioinformatics tools were used to analyze these DEGs. The STRING database. ToppGene database and DICE were employed for this integrative analysis.\nRESULTS: The network generated by the STRING database identified six pivotal genes: TNF, BDNF, IL-6, NR3C1, IGF2, and POMC. These genes regulate response to endogenous hormones, particularly cortisol secretion in newborns, as well as inhibiting serotonin secretion. Moreover, these genes are linked to major depressive disorder and other mental diseases, contributing to maternal and neonatal gut microbiota dysbiosis.

Recent evidence indicates that gut microbiota significantly contributes to the development of inflammation and cognitive impairments following brain injury. However, the mechanisms by which gut microbiota influence inflammation and cognitive function in the neonates after HIBD are not well understood. This study established a neonatal rat model of HIBD by the classic Rice-Vannucci technique to investigate gut dysbiosis following hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult and to elucidate the causal relationship between gut dysbiosis and cognitive impairments. Our results demonstrated that HI insult resulted in significant gut microbial dysbiosis, characterized by an expansion of Enterobacteriaceae. This dysbiosis was associated with intestinal barrier damage, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) leakage, and systemic inflammation. Conversely, administration of aminoguanidine (AG) to inhibit Enterobacteriaceae overgrowth restored intestinal barrier integrity and reduced systemic inflammation. Importantly, AG treatment effectively suppressed microglial activation, neuronal damage, and cognitive impairments in the neonatal rats subjected to HI insult. Additionally, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes in both colonic and hippocampal tissues were primarily associated with inflammation and neuronal apoptosis after HI insult. Further mechanistic exploration revealed that AG treatment mitigated intestinal LPS leakage, thereby reducing the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway and production of the downstream inflammatory cytokines in both the colon and hippocampus. Notably, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from the HIBD rats to the antibiotic cocktail-treated recipient rats resulted in microglial activation, neuronal damage, and cognitive impairments in the recipients. However, these adverse effects were effectively mitigated in the recipient rats that received FMT from the AG-treated donors, as well as in those undergoing hippocampal TLR4 knockdown. In conclusion, our findings indicate that LPS derived from gut Enterobacteriaceae overgrowth plays a critical role in the TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling, providing a novel microbiota-based therapeutic approach for cognitive impairments following neonatal HIBD."

Zebrafish were exposed to CK, LF, MF, and HF for 90 days. The results showed that chronic fluoride exposure caused damage to the brain tissues of adult zebrafish and significantly reduced the total distance of free swimming per min. Fluoride significantly reduced dopamine content and dopamine pathway related gene expression in brain. In addition, fluoride disrupted the intestinal barrier function, reduced the expression of tight junction proteins and mucin related genes in intestinal tissues, increased intestinal permeability. Males in the HF group were more sensitive than the corresponding females. Fluoride significantly decreased the dopamine content in the intestine, disturbed the gene expression of dopamine pathway related genes. Fluoride significantly increased the relative abundance of g_uncultured_bacterium_c_Gammaprotebacteria in three F groups, while significantly reduced the relative abundance of g_lactobacilli and g_Lachnospiraceae NK4A136_group. At the same time, metabolic pathways including amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism were also affected. These indicate that fluoride can result in neurotoxicity and behavioral changes by disrupting intestinal permeability and causing intestinal damage caused by imbalance of gut microbiota nucleotide metabolism, and the abnormal expression of dopamine related genes in the gut in zebrafish.

Among these, p-cresol, a by-product of tyrosine breakdown, has gained significant attention in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. However, current methods fail to detect p-cresol at trace levels in both the systemic circulation and brain, limiting the study of its role in neuropsychiatric disorders. There, the precise and accurate determination of p-cresol at low picogram levels is an unmet analytical need. To address this gap, we developed a highly-sensitive, validated method for quantifying p-cresol at low picogram levels in urine, plasma, and brain using chemical derivatization and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We found that derivatization with 1,2-dimethylimidazole-5-sulfonyl chloride (5-DMIS-Cl or 5-DMISC) increased up to 40-fold the sensitivity compared to traditional dansyl derivatization. Therefore, a method based on 5-DMISC derivatization and sum of transitions was selected for validation. The method was accurate (recoveries 91-100 %) and precise (RSD <15 %) in all tested matrices, enabling detection down to100 pg/mL for urine, 20 pg/mL for plasma, and 0.04 pg/mg for brain tissue. The method was applied to plasma and brain samples from control and p-cresol-treated mice, revealing significant increases in p-cresol levels in treated animals. For the first time, we successfully quantified p-cresol levels in the brain, demonstrating its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. In summary, this validated method offers a powerful tool for exploring the role of p-cresol -and potentially other phenolic compounds-in the microbiota-gut-brain axis and neuropsychiatric disorders."

The species Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is highly ubiquitous and presents great genetic diversity making it difficult to conduct massive screening of probiotic strains when using conventional methods. Hence, this work aimed to taxonomically and functionally characterize the complete genomes of six novel L. plantarum strains isolated in Brazil through high-standard NGS. The taxonomy of strains E6, E10, E14, E18, Lpl2, and Lpl4 was investigated through average nucleotide identity analysis using the genome of L. plantarum SK151 from the GENBANK database as a reference. Moreover, multilocus phylogenetic analyses were performed to investigate their genetic relatedness to probiotic L. plantarum strains using a total of 225 complete genomes from the same database. To investigate specific health-promoting and safety properties, the isolates from Brazil were analyzed using several bioinformatic tools to predict antimicrobials and anti-inflammatory biomolecules and potential risk factors including drug resistance, virulence genes, and genetic mobility elements. The results confirmed that all six isolates belong to the species L. plantarum and the phylogenetic analysis suggests high proximity to known probiotics and strains that have demonstrated protective effects against inflammation and pathogens. Several bacteriocin genes were identified in the Brazilian isolates, mostly plantaricins, suggesting antimicrobial properties, especially in the strain E14 that presented 9 bacteriocins genes. Furthermore, the study revealed the potential capacity of these strains to produce anti-inflammatory compounds including metabolites such as butyrate through the fermentation of fructan sugars, and IL-10 stimulation activity mediated by adhesin proteins from the bacterial cell wall. The lpl4 strain glutamate decarboxylase (GADB) gene showed a high degree of genetic and structural conservation prediction and increased stabilization of the predicted protein compared to a functional homologous GADB from L. plantarum Taj-Apis362, suggesting lpl4 potential for the modulation of the gut-brain axis functions by the production of GABA. Regarding the presence of virulence and resistance genes, only one resistance island was observed in strain E6 genome. In conclusion, it is possible to suggest that most of the evaluated strains are safe and we highlight the strains Lpl4 and E14 for presenting outstanding enteroprotective properties such as the potential production of GABA and several bacteriocins."

It has been demonstrated that gut microbiota is closely associated with the prognosis of various neurological disorders. However, the role of microbiota-gut-brain axis on cognitive function following neonatal HIBD remains elusive. In this experiment, the correlation analysis supported the involvement of gut microbial changes following hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult in the development of long-term cognitive impairments. Subsequent experiment revealed the involvement of the intestinal dysfunction in the hippocampal neuroinflammation and synaptic injury. In causal relationship validation experiments, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from cognitively normal rats could restore gut microbial composition, improve intestinal dysfunction, reduce the serum levels of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and inflammatory mediators, and alleviate neuroinflammation, synaptic damage and cognitive impairments in neonatal HIBD recipient rats. Conversely, the FMT from neonatal HIBD rats could induce above adverse pathological changes in the normal recipient rats. Moreover, oral administration of anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone (DEX) exhibited the potential to alleviate these detrimental effects in neonatal HIBD rats, with the efficacy being partly reliant on gut microbiota. Further experiment on the potential molecular mechanisms using RNA sequencing indicated a significant increase in the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene in the intestinal tissues of neonatal HIBD rats. Additionally, the interventions such as TLR4 inhibitor TLR4-IN-C34 administration, FMT, and oral DEX were demonstrated to modulate intestinal function by inhibiting the LPS/TLR4 signaling pathway, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects. Collectively, these findings underscore the contribution of gut microbial dysbiosis post HI insult in activating the LPS/TLR4 signaling pathway, triggering intestinal inflammation and dysfunction, exacerbating systemic inflammation, and consequently worsening synaptic and cognitive impairments in neonatal HIBD rats. Hence, rectifying gut microbial dysbiosis or regulating intestinal function may represent a promising strategy for alleviating long-term cognitive impairments in neonates affected by HIBD."

A parallel, randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled study was performed in generally healthy women (n = 112). Women were randomised to either the probiotic (n = 58, mean age 38.38 ± 0.85 years) or placebo (n = 54, mean age 38.91 ± 0.98 years) for 12-weeks. Immunity and mental wellbeing profiles were evaluated via questionnaires and blood gene expression profiles. Over the study period, the Probio87 group demonstrated a better impact on general women's health as compared to the control group, as measured by the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ), particularly in domains related to depressed mood, somatic symptoms, anxiety, sexual health, sleep, and menstrual health. The probiotic effects were exhibited later, typically after 6-weeks of intervention, taking over placebo effects that primarily faded off during early stages of the intervention. Regarding immunity, women in the Probio87 group exhibited upregulation of more immunity-related genes than those in the placebo group, primarily associated with NK cells and anti-inflammatory effects via IL-10. Additionally, Probio87 provided gut-brain axis benefits by enhancing the actions of neurotransmitters serotonin and GABA, while also balancing hunger and satiety. The probiotic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Probio87 significantly improved general health, mood, anxiety, and sleep in a generally healthy women population over 12 weeks. It enhanced immune function through increased expression of immunity-related genes and positively modulated neurotransmitters involved in brain health. All these findings supported from our WHQ data, where the administration of probiotic improved domains related to depressed mood, anxiety, sexual behaviour and sleep problems.

While its etiology is multifactorial, encompassing vascular, neurological, hormonal, and psychological components, emerging evidence suggests a significant role for gut microbiota dysbiosis in its development. The gut microbiota influences various metabolic, inflammatory, and neuropsychological processes critical to erectile function. Dysbiosis can lead to systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, and altered neurotransmitter production, all of which are key factors in ED pathogenesis. This narrative review synthesizes current research on the association between gut microbiota alterations and ED, highlighting specific bacterial taxa implicated in ED through mechanisms involving inflammation, metabolic disturbances, and hormonal regulation. This review explores potential mechanisms linking gut microbiota and ED, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, gut barrier integrity disruption, metabolic disorders, psychological factors via the gut-brain axis, and hormonal regulation. Furthermore, the gut microbiota offers promising avenues for developing non-invasive biomarkers and therapeutic interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modifications, and fecal microbiota transplantation. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies, mechanistic explorations, and clinical trials to validate these findings and translate them into clinical practice. Understanding the interplay between the gut microbiota and erectile function could unveil novel diagnostic biomarkers and pave the way for innovative treatments targeting the microbiota, ultimately improving men's sexual and overall health."

Pain, as the most common clinical symptom of endometriosis, severely affects women's physical and mental health and exacerbates socioeconomic burden. However, the specific mechanisms behind the occurrence of endometriosis-related pain remain unclear. It is currently believed that the occurrence of endometriosis pain is related to various factors, such as immune abnormalities, endocrine disorders, the brain-gut axis, angiogenesis, and mechanical stimulation. These factors induce systemic chronic inflammation, which stimulates the nerves and subsequently alters neural plasticity, leading to nociceptive sensitization and thereby causing chronic pain. In this paper, we compile and review the articles published on the study of nociceptive sensitization and endometriosis pain mechanisms. Starting from the factors influencing the chronic pain associated with endometriosis, we explain the relationship between these factors and chronic inflammation and further elaborate on the potential mechanisms by which chronic inflammation induces nociceptive sensitization. We aim to reveal the possible mechanisms of endometriosis pain, as well as nociceptive sensitization, and offer potential new targets for the treatment of endometriosis pain."

Therefore, the aim of this narrative review is to thoroughly analyze the ways in which microbiota might affect the aging process and age-related cognitive decline. Overall, aging is a complex phenomenon manifested at systemic, cellular and molecular levels. According to recent studies, gut microbiota composition may influence age-related changes through the gut-brain axis. One mechanism involves dysbiosis-related chronic systemic inflammation, leading to the blood-brain barrier disruption and subsequent neuroinflammatory processes. In addition to inflammaging, gut microbiota may induce oxidative stress, which is another key factor in brain aging.

A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was utilized to investigate the impact of GH on IS. Our 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed that GH markedly enhanced the α-diversity of the intestinal microbiome and rectified the imbalance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Metabolomic analysis indicated that GH reversed 45 biomarkers and 6 disordered metabolic pathways in MCAO rats. Among these, the metabolic pathways of arachidonic acid, α-linolenic acid, fructose, and mannose were closely associated with gut microbiota comprising Lactobacillus modulated by GH. Furthermore, IS-related signaling pathways, including inflammation, autophagy, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, were significantly associated with three gut microbial species influenced by GH. The potential efficacy of GH in the context of IS is mediated through multiple pathways, involving the gut microbiota, SCFAs, biomarkers, and target proteins.

        "abstract": "Para-cresol (p-cresol), and its primary human metabolite p-cresol sulfate (pCS), are among the most studied gut-derived metabolites relevant to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). P-cresol is produced by bacterial modification of phenylalanine or tyrosine and is one of many potentially deleterious metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. Seventeen studies have observed p-cresol and/or p-cresol sulfate as being higher in the urine of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) vs. controls. P-cresol has harmful effects on the body, including within the gut, brain, kidneys, liver, immune system, and mitochondria. Some of these effects may contribute to autism and comorbid symptoms. In the gut, p-cresol acts as an antibiotic, altering the gut microbiome to favor the bacteria that produce it. In the mitochondria, p-cresol disrupts ATP production and increases oxidative stress, which is also common in autism. In the brain, p-cresol impairs neuronal development. P-cresol inactivates dopamine beta-hydroxylase, which converts dopamine to noradrenaline. P-cresol sulfate impairs kidney function and is linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is more common in ASD adults. P-cresol also interferes with immune function. Three animal studies have demonstrated that p-cresol causes autism-related symptoms in mice, and that mice can be recovered by the administration of fecal microbiota transplant from healthy mice. Similarly, it was found that microbiota transplant therapy treatment in children with ASD significantly reduced p-cresol sulfate levels to normal and led to significant improvements in gastrointestinal (GI) and ASD symptoms. In summary, p-cresol and pCS likely contribute to ASD core symptoms in a substantial subset of children with ASD."

        "abstract": "Aside from its immediate traumatic effects, spinal cord injury (SCI) presents multiple secondary complications that can be harmful to those who have been affected by SCI. Among these secondary effects, gut dysbiosis (GD) and the activation of the NOD (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) like receptor-family pyrin-domain-containing three (NLRP3) inflammasome are of special interest for their roles in impacting mental health. Studies have found that the state of the gut microbiome is thrown into disarray after SCI, providing a chance for GD to occur. Metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and a variety of neurotransmitters produced by the gut microbiome are hampered by GD. This disrupts healthy cognitive processes and opens the door for SCI patients to be impacted by mental health disorders. Additionally, some studies have found an increased presence and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its respective parts in SCI patients. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can initiate and eventually aggravate mental health disorders after SCI. In addition to the mechanisms of GD and the NLRP3 inflammasome in intensifying mental health disorders after SCI, this review article further focuses on three promising treatments: fecal microbiome transplants, phytochemicals, and melatonin. Studies have found these treatments to be effective in combating the pathogenic mechanisms of GD and NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as alleviating the symptoms these complications may have on mental health. Another area of focus of this review article is exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to support treatments. AI models have already been developed to track changes in the gut microbiome, simulate drug-gut interactions, and design novel anti-NLRP3 inflammasome peptides. While these are promising, further research into the applications of AI for the treatment of mental health disorders in SCI is needed."

Neurodevelopment is determined by many events, including the maturation and colonization of the infant microbiome and its metabolites, specifically neurotransmitters, immune modulators, vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids. Successful microbiome maturation and gut-brain axis function depend on maternal factors (stress and exposure to toxins during pregnancy), mode of delivery, quality of the postnatal environment, diet after weaning from breast milk, and nutritional deficiencies. While the neonatal microbiome is highly plastic, it remains prone to dysbiosis which, once established, may persist into adulthood, thereby inducing the development of chronic inflammation and abnormal excitatory/inhibitory balance, resulting in neural excitation.

These interactions are mediated by molecules (metabolites) produced in both areas, which are considered mediators. To shed light on this complex mechanism, which is still largely unknown, a reliable characterization of the mediators is essential. Here, we review the most studied metabolites in the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the metabolic pathways in which they are involved, and their functions. This review focuses mainly on the use of mass spectrometry for their determination, reporting on the latest analytical methods, their limitations, and future perspectives. The analytical strategy for the qualitative-quantitative characterization of mediators must be reliable in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the influence of the above-mentioned axis on stress resilience or vulnerability."

Children with ASD also frequently experience co-morbidities including anxiety and ADHD, and up to 80% experience gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as constipation, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain. Systemic immune activation and dysregulation, including increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, are frequently observed in ASD. Evidence has shown that the innate immune system may be impacted in ASD, as altered monocyte gene expression profiles and cytokine responses to pattern recognition ligands have been observed compared to typically developing (TD) children. In humans, circulating monocytes are often categorized into three subpopulations-classical, transitional (or \"intermediate\"), and nonclassical monocytes, which can vary in functions, including archetypal inflammatory and/or reparative functions, as well as their effector locations. The potential for monocytes to contribute to immune dysregulation in ASD and its comorbidities has so far not been extensively studied. This study aims to determine whether these monocyte subsets differ in frequency in children with ASD and if the presence of GI symptoms alters subset distribution, as has been seen for T cell subsets.

Here, we wanted to determine whether obese phenotype and hypothalamic response to a high-fat diet (HFD) differed between male and female C57Bl/6J mice. Mice were exposed to either a 60% HFD or a standard diet first for both a long- (14 weeks) and shorter-periods of time (3, 7, 14 and 28 days). Analysis of the expression profile of key neuronal, glial and inflammatory hypothalamic markers was performed using RT-qPCR. In addition, astrocytic and microglial morphology was examined in the arcuate nucleus. Monitoring of body weight and composition revealed that body weight and fat mass gain appeared earlier and was more pronounced in male mice. After 14 weeks of HFD exposure, normalized increase of body weight reached similar levels between male and female mice. Overall, both sexes under HFD displayed a decrease of orexigenic neuropeptides expression while an increase in Pomc gene expression was observed only in female mice. In addition, changes in the expression of hypothalamic inflammatory markers were relatively modest. We also reported that the glial cell markers expression and morphology were affected by HFD in a sex- and time dependent manner, suggesting a more pronounced glial cell activation in female mice. Taken together, these data show that male and female mice responded differently to HFD exposure, both on short- and long-term and suggest that a strong inflammatory hypothalamic profile is not systematically present in diet-induced obesity models. Nevertheless, in addition to these present data, the underlying mechanisms should be deciphered in further investigations."

Despite treatments with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange, GBS remains characterized by variability in recovery and high incidence of residual disabilities. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ANX005, a novel therapeutic targeting the classical complement cascade.\nMETHODS: Patients with recent-onset GBS, who had no access to intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange, received escalating doses of ANX005 or placebo as a single IV infusion. Primary objectives included assessments of safety. Secondary objectives included determination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and clinical outcomes through Week 8. Exploratory objectives included an evaluation of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement and tissue damage biomarkers.\nRESULTS: Fifty patients were randomized to receive either ANX005 (n = 38) or placebo (n = 12). ANX005 was well-tolerated across all doses with no dose-limiting toxicities, suggesting an acceptable safety profile. Pharmacodynamic data showed effective C1q inhibition and a reduction in neurofilament light chain levels, suggesting nerve damage mitigation. Exploratory endpoints evaluating clinical outcomes included improvements in Medical Research Council sum scores, GBS-Disability Score, and Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale with ANX005 compared to placebo, particularly in patients receiving doses that inhibited serum C1q for ≥ 1 week and provided C1q blockade in the CSF.\nINTERPRETATION: These results support ANX005 as a targeted therapy for GBS that modulates the classical complement pathway. Further investigation in a larger Phase 3 trial is warranted to confirm these results and assess the long-term benefits of complement inhibition in patients with GBS."

Pittman's work leaves a legacy of ground-breaking discoveries, impeccable research, and generous mentorship. His work on thermoregulation, vasopressin, perinatal programming, and hypothalamic function laid a good part of the foundation of the psychoneuroimmunology research we do today. His interest in neuroinflammation led to important findings in animal models of chronic peripheral inflammation including colitis and central inflammatory states observed in epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. His integrative approach, ranging from electrophysiological recordings to whole animal behaviour helped answer physiological questions involving the orchestrated functions and interactions of multiple organs. He is one of a few neuroscientists who raised the question of the contribution of peripheral organs to brain function and plasticity at a time when the field was largely neurocentric. Pittman has enhanced our collective understanding of the effects of neonatal inflammation (and other models of perinatal programming) on the adult brain, and has even revealed key ways in which neurons in the brain communicate with each other, through his work on vasopressin, endocannabinoids, and other transmitters. Altogether, Quentin Pittman's interdisciplinary work has laid a solid foundation for psychoneuroimmunology research and groundbreaking insight into brain-body integration."

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social communication and restricted, repetitive behavioral patterns. Although other physiological presentations in individuals with ASD are heterogeneous, neuroimaging studies have consistently revealed a developmental pattern of initial white matter hypermyelination followed by reduced myelination compared with typically developing peers. Multiple studies have demonstrated that core ASD symptoms, including impairments in social skills, language acquisition, learning capabilities, motor performance, and sensory processing, correlate significantly with white matter dysregulation measured through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Longitudinal studies have shown that decreased gut microbiome diversity, particularly reductions in beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, correlates with symptom severity. Emerging mechanistic evidence suggests bidirectional relationships between microbiome composition and white matter development, both directly through metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that regulate oligodendrocyte function and subsequent myelination, and indirectly through modulation of neuroinflammatory pathways. By integrating molecular-level gut physiology findings with macro-level brain imaging data, we may identify novel therapeutic approaches targeting the gut-brain axis in ASD management."

This gut microbiota engages in two-way communication with the central nervous system, collectively known as the gut microbiota-brain axis. Alterations in gut microbiota have been associated with various neurological disorders, and disruptions to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may be crucial, though the exact mechanisms remain unknown. In the current study, we investigated the impacts of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on the integrity of the BBB, which was compromised by orally administered antibiotics in rhesus monkeys and C57BL/6n mice. Our results showed that SCFA supplementation notably enhanced BBB integrity in rhesus monkeys with gut dysbiosis. Similar outcomes were observed in mice with gut dysbiosis, accompanied by decreased cortical claudin-5 mRNA levels. In particular, propionate, but not acetate or butyrate, could reverse the antibiotic-induced BBB permeability increase in mice. Additionally, in vitro studies demonstrated that propionate boosted the expression of tight junction proteins in brain endothelial cells. These results suggest that the propionate can maintain BBB integrity through a free fatty acid receptor 2-dependent mechanism. This study offers new insights into the gut-brain axis and underscores potential therapeutic targets for interventions based on gut microbiota."

These mechanisms have inspired the development of innovative applications, including personalized probiotics, synbiotics, artificial microbiomes, bioinspired biosensors, and bioremediation systems. Such technologies aim to emulate and optimize the intricate functions of microbial ecosystems, addressing challenges in healthcare and environmental sustainability. The integration of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, bioengineering, and multi-omics approaches, has further accelerated the potential of microbiota biomimetics. These tools enable the development of precision therapies tailored to individual microbiota profiles, enhance the efficacy of diagnostic systems, and facilitate the design of environmentally sustainable solutions, such as waste-to-energy systems and bioremediation platforms. Emerging areas of innovation, including gut-on-chip models and synthetic biology, offer unprecedented opportunities for studying and applying microbiota principles in controlled environments. Despite these advancements, challenges remain. The replication of microbial complexity in artificial environments, ethical concerns regarding genetically engineered microorganisms, and equitable access to advanced therapies are critical hurdles that must be addressed. This review underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and public awareness in overcoming these barriers and ensuring the responsible development of microbiota-based solutions.

However, the specific role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in poststroke aphasia (PSA) patients remains unclear.\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships among the gut microbiota, neuroendocrine-immune network, brain network properties, and language function in patients with PSA.\nDESIGN: This is a cross-sectional, observational, monocentric study.\nMETHODS: This study enrolled 15 PSA patients, 10 non-PSA patients, and 15 healthy controls (HCs). All subjects underwent stool microbiota analysis, blood inflammatory cytokines assessment, and brain-gut peptide examination. PSA patients and HCs underwent additional resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) brain scans. The rs-fMRI data were utilized to create whole-brain connectivity maps, and graph theory was employed to characterize the network topological properties. Analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used for comparisons among the three groups. Correlation analyses were subsequently conducted to explore relationships among factors showing significant group differences.\nRESULTS: Compared with non-PSA patients and HCs, PSA patients displayed alterations in the gut microbiota composition, increased systemic inflammation, changes in brain-gut peptides, and had worse language performance. Graph theoretical analysis revealed that PSA patients exhibited small-world topology. Furthermore, nodal measures in brain network analysis showed activation of homologous speech areas in the right hemisphere, while the nodal properties of brain regions near the lesion in the left hemisphere decreased in patients with PSA compared with HCs.\nCONCLUSION: The present study revealed, for the first time, that an imbalance in gut microbiota was accompanied by the neuroendocrine-immune network disorder and abnormal changes in the brain network in PSA patients.\nAlterations in the gut microbiota may influence language recovery in patients with poststroke aphasia Aphasia is one of the most common complications of stroke, affecting approximately one-third of stroke survivors. Poststroke aphasia (PSA) is associated with more severe strokes, higher mortality, slower functional recovery, and greater healthcare costs compared to stroke patients without PSA. The unique characteristics of human language, which cannot be fully replicated in animal models, present a significant barrier to exploring the pathogenesis of PSA. Consequently, understanding the underlying neural pathways and identifying novel therapeutic targets is critically important. Recent evidence highlights the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain, referred to as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Our prior studies have demonstrated gut microbiota imbalances in patients with acute ischemic stroke, which significantly influence outcomes and prognosis. Considering the marked differences in disease severity and long-term prognosis between PSA patients and non-PSA patients, we hypothesized that variations in the microbiota-gut-brain axis might be linked to language function. To test this hypothesis, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 16S rDNA sequencing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to explore differences in gut microbiota composition, neuroendocrine-immune network (NEI) network indicators, and brain network topology among PSA patients, non-PSA patients, and healthy controls (HCs). Our findings revealed that PSA patients, compared to non-PSA patients and HCs, exhibited gut microbiota dysbiosis, increased inflammatory responses, abnormal secretion of brain-gut peptides, and early activation of homologous language-related regions in the right hemisphere. These results provide new insights into the role of the gut microbiota in language recovery in PSA and highlight the gut microbiota as a promising therapeutic target for this condition."

We engineered the Lactobacillus paracasei F19 (LP) to express the human N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-preferring phospholipase D (NAPEpld) gene and to produce OEA in response to dietary ultra-low oleate supply. We treated 12-week HFD male mice with oleate-probiotic formulations and assessed their impact on metabolic and behavioral dysfunctions, and microbiota-gut-brain signaling after 8 weeks of treatment. NAPE-expressing LP (pNAPE-LP) led to significant reduced weight loss and improved metabolic dysfunction in HFD-treated mice. Further, a parallel improvement in depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes was associated with the duodenal barrier function retrieval, the restoration of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and an increase in beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Parabacteroides. The HFD-driven changes both in the enteric and central nervous system were prevented by pNAPE-LP/oleate treatment. Collectively, our data suggest that these effects were mediated by the oleate-dependent release of OEA by pNAPE-LP since no significant effects were observed in HFD mice treated with the native probiotic alone (pLP). This oleate-regulated delivery system of OEA is a safe and efficient probiotic-based strategy for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and related behavioral disorders."

There is also evidence in rodent models that there is potential application of food, herbal medicines, probiotics, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as novel therapies for migraine. Evidence from human cohorts suggests that there is altered gut microbiota in people with migraine, and that the microbiome dysbiosis is from both compositional and functional aspects. Recent metagenome-wide association studies (MWAS) that employ Mendelian Randomization support the causal association between gut microbiota and migraine. The connection between migraine and the gut microbiome remains underexplored, but recent preclinical and clinical studies support the association between gut microbiota and the development of migraine."

Here, we analyzed the GABA-producer Lactococcus lactis CNCM I-5388 as an active-enzyme postbiotic to relieve VH mediated by psychological stress. L. lactis CNCM I-5388 was inactivated by ethanol while maintaining its glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity. This EtOH-treated nonviable form was given daily orally for 1, 5, or 10 days to female Wistar rats in comparison with viable L. lactis CNCM I-5388 or vehicle. Visceral sensitivity was measured by electromyography before and after partial restraint stress (PRS). GABA was quantified in the stomach collected from rats and in the gastric compartment of TIM-1 human gut model in fed state. A daily treatment for 5 and 10 days by L. lactis CNCM I-5388 both in its viable and nonviable forms counteracted VH promoted by PRS. However, only viable L. lactis CNCM I-5388 tended to reduce VH after a single administration. After 5-day treatment, only under PRS conditions, the production of GABA within the stomach was enhanced in rats treated with viable or nonviable L. lactis CNCM I-5388. This increase was confirmed by using the TIM-1 human gut model. We found that a postbiotic with an active-GAD enzyme of L. lactis CNCM I-5388, similarly to its viable psychobiotic form, exerts anti-VH properties in an IBS-like rat model. These effects are associated with GABA production in the stomach where the low pH promotes GAD activity."

This review discusses the association between depression and glial cell-induced neuroinflammation and elucidates the role of glial cell crosstalk in neuroinflammation. Firstly, we focus on the role of glial cells in neuroinflammation in depression and glial cell interactions; secondly, we categorize changes in different glial cells in animal models of depression and depressed patients, focusing on how glial cells mediate inflammatory responses and exacerbate depressive symptoms; Thirdly, we review how conventional and novel antidepressants affect the phenotype and function of glial cells, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory activity; finally, we discuss the role of the gut-brain axis in glial cell function and depression, and objectively analyze the problems that remain in current antidepressant therapy. This review aims to provide an objective analysis of how glial cell cross-talk may mediate neuroinflammation and thereby influence pathologic progression of depression. It is concluded that a novel therapeutic strategy may be to ameliorate glial cell-mediated inflammatory responses."

Growing research highlights the role of intestinal microbiota and their metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in modulating HD progression. SCFAs, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are produced by gut bacteria through dietary fiber fermentation and are recognized for their neuroprotective properties. Evidence suggests that SCFAs regulate neuroinflammation, neuronal communication, and metabolic functions within the central nervous system (CNS). In HD, these compounds may support neuronal health, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Their mechanisms of action involve binding to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and modulating gene expression through epigenetic pathways, underscoring their therapeutic potential. This analysis examines the significance of SCFAs in HD, emphasizing the gut-brain axis and the benefits of dietary interventions aimed at modifying gut microbiota composition and promoting SCFA production.

Understanding the interplay between dementia and depression is crucial, as depression may not only co-occur with but also potentially exacerbate the progression of dementia. This study employs bibliometric analysis to map the global research landscape, identify prevailing themes, and discern future research directions.\nMETHODS: We analyzed reviews and original research articles on dementia and depression extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection spanning from 2005 to 2024. Utilizing tools such as CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and an R-based bibliometric analysis package, we assessed trends in publication volume, citation frequency, contributing countries, leading institutions, predominant journals, influential authors, and emergent keywords.\nRESULTS: A total of 1972 publications were obtained, revealing a consistent increase in both the number of publications and their citation impact over the study period. The United States is the country with the most publications and the most extensive collaborations. The University of Toronto and the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease were identified as key contributors to this field. This research area is currently focused on cognitive impairments, the role of gut microbiota, and non-drug interventions. Future directions emphasize the importance of early detection and intervention, a deeper understanding of the gut-brain axis, and the integration of technology in treatment strategies. Additionally, there is a growing interest in the physiological and psychological interplays such as oxidative stress and its implications.\nCONCLUSION: This study underscores pathogenesis, comorbid conditions, and non-drug interventions as primary research focal points, suggesting these areas as potential pathways for therapeutic innovation. These insights are intended to deepen our understanding, enhance diagnostics, and improve the management of dementia and depression, providing guidance for future research aimed at addressing these escalating global health challenges."

        "abstract": "The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and gut-brain axes are vital biological pathways in depression. The HPA axis regulates the body's stress response, and chronic stress can lead to overactivation of the HPA axis, resulting in elevated cortisol levels that contribute to neuronal damage, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, both of which are involved in mood regulation and mental disorders. In parallel, the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, influences emotional and cognitive functions. Imbalances in gut microbiota can affect the HPA axis, promoting inflammation and increasing gut permeability. This allows endotoxins to enter the bloodstream, contributing to neuroinflammation and altering neurotransmitter production, including serotonin. Since the majority of serotonin is produced in the gut, disruptions in this pathway may be linked to depressive symptoms. This review explores the interplay between the HPA axis and the gut-brain axis in the context of depression."

GLP-1 receptor agonists are therefore approved for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, more recent research has demonstrated that GLP-1 acts within the brain to modulate reward responses, thereby highlighting GLP-1 as a potential target for addiction. Specifically, preclinical studies demonstrated that GLP-1 receptor agonists decrease alcohol intake, reduce the motivation to consume alcohol, and prevent relapse drinking by potentially lowering alcohol-induced reward. These preclinical results have been confirmed and extended in human studies in which GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce alcohol intake in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) who have a regular weight or comorbidity of obesity or type 2 diabetes. On a similar note, genetic variations in genes encoding for the GLP-1 receptor are associated with AUD and heavy drinking. The central mechanisms by which GLP-1 regulates alcohol-related behaviors are not fully defined, but may involve areas central to reward as well as regions projecting to these reward areas, such as the nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem. Together, existing preclinical and clinical data suggest that GLP-1 is involved in the AUD process and implies its role as a tentative treatment for AUD."

In our study, we found bacterial sequences, including gut-related ones, in the brains of mice with implanted microelectrodes. These sequences changed over time. Mice treated with antibiotics showed a reduced presence of these bacteria and had a different inflammatory response, which temporarily improved microelectrode recording performance. However, long-term antibiotic use worsened performance and disrupted neurodegenerative pathways. Many bacterial sequences found were not present in the gut or in unimplanted brains.

Clinical observations support the notion of the gut-brain connection, including an increased prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with depression and anxiety, as well as the association of changes in the gut microbiota with neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. The gut and brain communicate via complex mechanisms involving inflammatory cytokines, immune cells, autonomic nerves, and gut microbiota, which contribute to the pathogenesis in certain gut and brain diseases. Two primary pathways mediate the bidirectional information exchange between the intestinal tract and the brain: signal transduction through bloodstream factors, such as bacterial metabolites and inflammatory cytokines, and neural pathways, such as neurotransmitters and inflammatory cytokines within the autonomic nervous system through the interaction between the nerve cells and beyond. In recent years, the basic mechanisms of the pathophysiology of the gut-brain axis have been gradually elucidated. Beyond the gut-brain interaction, emerging evidence suggests the influence of the gut extends to other organs, such as the liver and lungs, through intricate inter-organ communication pathways. An increasing number of reports on this clinical and basic cross-organ interactions underscore the potential for better understanding and novel therapeutic strategies targeting inter-organs networks.

We investigated the fecal microbiome in patients with liver cirrhosis and its potential function as a predictive biomarker of hepatic encephalopathy.\nMETHODS: Patients were divided into either a high plasma ammonia (HPA) group or a low plasma ammonia (LPA) group according to the upper limit of normal of plasma ammonia concentration. 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples was performed to study how the microbiota affects the clinical symptoms of liver cirrhosis. The Stroop test was used to assess the ability of the brain to inhibit habitual behaviors.\nRESULTS: Totally, 21 subjects were enrolled. Among the 18 patients with liver cirrhosis, 14 were male, the age range was 42-56 years, and the plasma ammonia level range was 20-125.9 μmol/l. The Stroop test showed more severe cognitive impairment in HPA than in LPA individuals. At the same time, there were significant differences in fecal microbiome characteristics between the two groups, characterized by a further increase in the abundance of the Proteobacteria phylum in the gut (especially aerobic Enterobacteriaceae ). Function predictions of Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States in the microbiome further explained the increase in the Enterobacteriaceae -dominated polyamine synthesis pathway in the gut microbiome of HPA groups.\nCONCLUSION: Cirrhotic patients with hyperammonemia have a specific fecal bacterial composition (characterized via expansion of Enterobacteriaceae ).

Our lab has previously established the gut microbiome as a driver of various side effects of opioid use, including analgesic tolerance and somatic withdrawal symptoms. We therefore hypothesized that the gut microbiome contributes to the development of anxiety-like behavior during protracted opioid withdrawal. In this study, we first established a mouse model of protracted morphine withdrawal, characterized by anxiety-like behavior and gut microbial dysbiosis. Next, we used fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to show that gut dysbiosis alone is sufficient to induce anxiety-like behavior. We further demonstrate that probiotic therapy during morphine withdrawal attenuates the onset of anxiety-like behavior, highlighting its therapeutic potential. Lastly, we examined transcriptional changes in the amygdala of morphine-withdrawn mice treated with probiotics to explore mechanisms by which the gut-brain axis mediates anxiety-like behavior. Our results support the use of probiotics as a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent gut dysbiosis and associated anxiety during opioid withdrawal, with potential implications for improving treatment outcomes in opioid recovery programs."

Although the etiology and pathogenesis of ADHD are not fully understood, existing studies have shown that it may be related to genetic factors, environmental factors, abnormal brain development, and psychosocial factors. In recent years, with the concept of microbioa-gut-brain axis (MGBA), more and more studies have begun to pay attention to the effect of gut microbiota on ADHD. Dietary structure can significantly change the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota. Therefore, dietary supplements or food additives to regulate gut microbiota have become one of the potential ways to treat ADHD. Peppers, as an important dietary component, have potential value in regulating gut microbiota. Among them, capsaicin (8-methyl N-vanillyl-6-noneamide, CAP), as a key active component of peppers, has been shown to have potential therapeutic effects on central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and depression. In addition, much attention has been paid to the beneficial effects of CAP on gut microbiota. Chili peppers contain not only CAP, but also rich in vitamin C and fatty acids, all of which may ameliorate ADHD by modulating the gut microbiota. This finding not only provides a potential treatment for ADHD, but also provides a new perspective to expand the research and clinical treatment of ADHD pathogenesis. Although current research on the potential therapeutic effects of chili peppers on ADHD is still at an early stage and requires further verification through larger-scale and more rigorous controlled studies, its potential clinical value cannot be ignored."

By contrast, we did not observe significant associations between fat-free mass and PTP1B and mortality at D28. Conclusion: We observed a trend of correlation between the whole blood PTPN1 gene expression at D1 and D4/D1 thickness of left quadriceps muscle, because this is the only data which has a potential to address the relationship body mass change and proteolysis."

        "abstract": "Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins and can induce weight loss and vomiting in animals. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying DON-induced anorexia in rabbits through the microbial-gut-brain axis. A total of forty rabbits were randomly divided into a DON group and a control group, receiving 1.5 mg/kg.BW of DON and an equivalent volume of saline daily via intragastric administration, respectively. The pre-treatment period lasted for 7 days, followed by a formal experimental period of 24 days. The findings revealed that DON exposure significantly reduced daily food intake and weight gain, leading to intestinal apoptosis and barrier injuries. 16S rRNA sequencing data indicated that DON exposure decreased the diversity and richness of cecal microflora, suppressed probiotic populations, and disrupted host lipid metabolism. RNA-Seq and iTRAQ data were used to cross-analyze the shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the hypothalamus and jejunum, along with their shared enrichment pathways, indicating that TNF-α, NF-κB, and NPY may play pivotal roles in DON-induced anorexia. qRT-PCR and Western blotting results confirmed significant increases in mRNA and protein expression levels of TNF-α, NF-κB and 5-HT2A in both the hypothalamus and jejunum. In conclusion, DON ingestion in rabbits can disrupt the intestinal barrier, up-regulate the expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, NF-κB, and 5-HT2A in the intestine, and trigger an immuno-inflammatory response in the hypothalamus via the microbial-gut-brain axis, ultimately resulting in appetite suppression and weight loss."

This study analyzes these changes and associations in order to predict and prevent hematoma expansion after emICH.\nMETHODS: The study included 100 participants, with 70 individuals diagnosed with emICH (30 with hematoma expansion and 40 without hematoma expansion, referred to as the HE and NE groups) and 30 healthy controls matched in terms of age and gender (HC). We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to explore the gut microbial structure and its underlying associations with blood inflammatory parameters in the HE group.\nRESULTS: Our findings showed a significant decrease in the diversity and even distribution of microorganisms in the HE group when compared to the HC and NE groups. The composition of the gut microbiota experienced notable alterations in the emICH group, especially in HE. These changes included a rise in the number of gram-negative pro-inflammatory bacteria and a decline in the level of probiotics.

We deduced that emICH could rapidly trigger the dysbiosis of intestinal flora, and the disturbed microbiota could, in turn, exacerbate inflammatory response and increase the risk of hematoma expansion.

        "abstract": "As life becomes more stressful, neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, and comorbidities of the two are becoming more and more of a concern. Multiple neuropsychiatric disorders share the same mental and somatic dysfunction and may involve common brain circuits and mechanistic targets. Music therapy, as an art form with proven efficacy, low cost and few side effects, is promoted for use in interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders. This may be closely related to the release of signaling molecules such as monoamine neurotransmitters, the glutamatergic system, the gut-microbiota-brain axis, pro-inflammatory cytokines and the endogenous opioid peptide system. However, fewer studies have mentioned the main targets of music to promote functional changes in brain regions. Therefore, this paper is a review of the mechanisms by which music therapy interacts with the prefrontal cortex-hippocampus-amygdala circuit through the aforementioned molecules. It is also hypothesized that glial cells, mitochondria and microRNAs are microscopic targets for musical intervention in neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim is to give new ideas for future research into the biological mechanisms of music therapy intervention in neuropsychiatric disorders."

HRM findings were compared based on single water swallows (SWS), and provocative testing with solid food swallows in the upright seated position, using both ManoView and Medical Measurement Systems software. We also calculated median pressure slopes during the compartmentalization phase.\nKEY RESULTS: Sixteen of the 39 included patients had mid-ED and 23 had lower ED. Twenty (51.3%) patients had motility disorders based on SWS, including 7 (18%) with achalasia and 3 (7.7%) with esophagogastric junction obstruction. No significant differences in esophageal motility disorders were observed in relation to the location of the ED. Solid food swallows were performed in 29 (74%) patients leading to a change in the HRM diagnosis in 7 (24.1%), all of whom showed elevated IRP.

Previous studies have shown phase-amplitude coupling between the electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha band frequency of the insula (Ins) and gastric slow wave (GSW) activity. This study investigated the first evidence of alpha band EEG-neurofeedback (EEG-NF) training to explore its effects on GSW activity and heart rate variability (HRV).\nMETHODS: A randomized crossover design was employed with 20 healthy participants attending two separate sessions [active-training: uptraining left posterior Insula (LPIns) and active-control: uptraining primary visual cortex (PVC Brodmann area 17)] following the baseline recording period. A 5-min water loading test (5WLT) was conducted following the EEG-NF sessions. Finally, a post EEG-NF/5WL period was also recorded. Participants were blinded to the training program, and the sessions were randomized and conducted at least 48 h apart. Electrocardiogram (ECG), EEG, and electrogastrogram (EGG) data were recorded throughout theexperiment. In addition, the duration of successful NF training was also extracted. Correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationships between outcome variables.\nRESULTS: Pearson correlation coefficient analysis revealed a significant relationship between the duration of successful NF training and HRV metrics (RMSSD: r = 0.59; p = 0.005, SI: r = -0.59; p = 0.006) in the LPIns training group and EGG-gastric rhythm index (r = -0.40; p = 0.028) in the PVC training group. Moreover, the duration of successful LPIns NF correlated with EEG activity of the infraslow band over the left anterior Ins (r = 0.45; p = 0.043), slow band over the right posterior Ins (r = -0.5; p = 0.022), and beta band over the left (r = 0.44; p = 0.04) and right anterior Ins (r = 0.45; p = 0.04). Significant correlations were also observed between LPIns NF duration and connectivity in the beta and gamma bands between cortical regions of interest.\nCONCLUSION: The alpha band EEG-NF training of LPIns demonstrated significant association with HRV, and EEG (activity and functional connectivity)measures and did not show a negative correlation with Gastric Alimetry Rhythm Index (GA-RI) following the 5WLT as in the PVC training group. These findings underscore the importance of considering the duration of successful NF as an important variable when evaluating NF training efficacy in future studies."

Post-CA brain injury (PCABI) is a major cause of death and poor recovery in CA patients and the current CA treatments are not very effective. The microbiome-gut-brain axis has been found to significantly affect brain ischemia injury. Furthermore, in ischemic stroke patients, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially sodium butyrate (SB), have been observed to promote neuroprotective effects by modulating inflammatory response and microglial polarization in the cortex. However, the precise mechanism of SB on CA-induced injury remains elusive. Therefore, this research study established an oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model using BV-2 microglial and HT22 cells to simulate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in vitro and a potassium chloride-induced CA mouse model to mimic CA in vivo. The data revealed that SB markedly improved neurological scores and reduced neuronal death and apoptosis. Moreover, it reduced M1 microglia and neuroinflammation in CA mice. In addition, SB increased intestinal integrity and alleviated systemic inflammation. The 16S rDNA sequencing analysis indicated that SB intervention mitigated CA-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and SCFA depletion. It was also observed that CA mice's brain and OGD/R-exposed BV2 cells had substantially increased levels of MyD88, phosphorylated NF-κB p65, and TLR4 proteins, which were reduced after SB treatment. In summary, this study revealed that SB can protect against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by controlling microglia polarization and microbiome-gut-brain axis to inhibit brain inflammation via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway."

Escitalopram (ESC) is a first-line antidepressant, however, its regulatory mechanisms on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the treatment of depression remain unclear. The antidepressant effects of ESC were evaluated using the forced swim test in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, while damage in the gut and brain regions was assessed through H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. The therapeutic mechanisms in WKY rats with depression-like behavior were investigated through 16S rRNA sequencing of the gut microbiota, serum untargeted metabolomics, and hippocampal proteomics. Results indicated that ESC intervention improved depressive-like behaviors, as evidenced by increased swimming times in WKY rats, and also restored intestinal permeability and brain tissue integrity. Significant changes in the gut microbiota composition, particularly an increase in Bacteroides barnesiae, as well as increases in serum sphingolipid metabolites (Sphinganine 1-phosphate, Sphingosine, and Sphingosine-1-phosphate) and hippocampal proteins (Sptlc1, Enpp5, Enpp2), were strongly correlated. These robust correlations suggest that ESC may exert its antidepressant effects by modulating sphingolipid metabolism through the influence of gut microbiota. Accordingly, this research elucidates novel mechanisms underlying the antidepressant efficacy of ESC and highlights the pivotal importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in mediating these effects."

However, the specific role and mechanism of the HPA in IBD pathogenesis remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the alterations in the HPA and its potential roles during IBD development.\nMETHODS: We utilized a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model in mice and employed immunofluorescence, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), among other techniques, to evaluate the impact of colitis on the HPA. Additionally, we used flow cytometry, adeno-associated virus-mediated gene silence, parabiosis and single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover the specific roles and mechanisms of the HPA in colitis.\nRESULTS: Our results indicate that colitis activates HPA secretion and increases α-MSH. α-MSH acts on the MC5R present on the surface of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow, altering the bone marrow microenvironment and promoting HSCs proliferation and differentiation into neutrophils. This process enhances the clearance of pathogenic microorganisms during the acute phase of colitis, while inducing sustained inflammatory responses during the remission phase.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, our study demonstrates the dual role of HPA activation and α-MSH secretion induced by colitis in the pathogenesis of IBD.

Enterococcus faecalis (EF) is a common commensal bacterium of the gut and a common pathogen associated with hospital-acquired infections. Here, we demonstrated the significant therapeutic effects of a non-pathogenic strain of EF (EF ATCC19433) on PD. In this study, we established a mouse model of PD by intraperitoneal injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). We found that EF treatment alleviated behavioral impairment, dopaminergic neuronal loss, blood-brain barrier damage, and neuroinflammation induced by MPTP in the mice. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that dysbiosis of PD-related microbial communities induced by MPTP was reversed by EF treatment. Moreover, EF treatment relieved gastrointestinal dysfunction in the mice. The therapeutic efficacy of EF in MPTP-induced PD mice is markedly diminished when the activity of EF is lost. Further mechanistic studies indicated that the neuroprotective effects of EF in PD were associated with the vagus nerve pathway. Following the surgical severance of the vagus nerve through subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, the protective effects of EF on PD were markedly diminished.

Although numerous studies have explored the relationship between IS and intestinal microbiota, comprehensive analyses of specific microbiota is relatively scarce. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of the typical changes in gut microbiota following IS and investigates the role of specific microorganisms in this context. Additionally, it presents a comprehensive analysis of post-stroke microbiological therapy and the relationship between IS and diet. The aim is to identify potential microbial targets for therapeutic intervention, as well as to highlight the benefits of microbiological therapies and the significance of dietary management. Overall, this paper seeks to provide key strategies for the treatment and management of IS, advocating for healthy diets and health programs for individuals. Meanwhile, it may offer a new perspective on the future interdisciplinary development of neurology, microbiology and nutrition."

        "abstract": "Triterpenoids derived from plants are a promising class of natural antidepressants. This research focused on the therapeutic potential of quinoa saponin (QS) in alleviating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in mice. The most abundant saponin fraction, QS-3, was isolated from QS extracts, and its major saponin components and chemical structure were elucidated. Six pentacyclic triterpene saponins and three tetracyclic triterpene saponins were identified in QS-3, with phytolaccagenin and oleanolic acid being the dominant sapogenins. In vivo studies demonstrated that QS significantly mitigated LPS-induced anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in mice, enhanced the levels of neurotrophic proteins, key synaptic proteins, and neurotransmitters, and restored synaptic function and neuronal damage. Furthermore, QS inhibited neuroinflammation by curtailing the activity of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and modulating microglial phenotypes. Notably, QS also ameliorated colonic inflammation by promoting gut microbiota homeostasis and increasing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production, which contributed to the improvement of anxiety and depressive behaviors in mice. Our findings suggest that QS holds potential as a natural dietary supplement for the treatment and prevention of anxiety and depression, possibly through its modulation of gut-brain axis dynamics and suppression of the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway."

        "abstract": "Chronic stress constitutes a major precipitating factor for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and comprehending individual differences in stress responses is crucial for the development of effective intervention strategies for MDD. Recent studies indicate that an individual's vulnerability to chronic stress is closely associated with gut microbiota composition, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate whether the gut microbiota and its metabolites can serve as gut-brain signaling molecules and explores how the gut microbiota affects stress sensitivity. Here, we showed that gut microbiome-derived indole-3-carboxaldehyde (I3C) can act as a gut-brain signaling molecule that links tryptophan metabolism by gut microbes to stress vulnerability in the host. First, we identified a specific reduction in gut microbiome-derived I3C levels in the hippocampus and colon through untargeted and targeted metabolomic analyses. Then, the study of gut microbiota suggested that the relative abundance of lactobacillus was reduced significantly in stress-susceptible rats, whereas fecal microbiota transplantation regulates stress vulnerability. Furthermore, supplementation with I3C and the representative I3C-producing strain, Lactobacillus reuteri, was shown to alleviate depression-like behaviors induced by chronic stress. Further research confirms that I3C can inhibit neuroinflammation and promote hippocampal neurogenesis through the aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR) signal pathway, thereby mitigating the host's susceptibility to stress. In conclusion, our findings elucidate that the gut microbiome-derived-I3C can help buffer the host's stress through the AhR/SOCS2/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway, providing a gut-brain signaling basis for emotional behavior."

The objective of the present cross-sectional study was to assess the educational level and occupational status of adult patients with paediatric-onset inflammatory bowel diseases from the EPIMAD Registry.\nMETHODS: The inclusion criteria were (i) a diagnosis of paediatric-onset (< 17 years at diagnosis) inflammatory bowel diseases, and (ii) age 25 or over at the time of study. The patients answered a self-questionnaire on their educational level and profession. The data were compared with those of the general population of the same age and geographic area.\nRESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-one patients (286 with Crohn's disease and 75 with ulcerative colitis) filled out and returned the questionnaire. The median [interquartile] age was 15.0 [12.9; 16.3] years at diagnosis and 34.2 [29.6; 39.5] years at the time of the study. Patients were more likely to have a higher education degree than the general population (57% vs. 41%, p < 0.0001). The unemployment rate was significantly lower among study participants than among the general population (9% vs. 15%, p = 0.001). Salaried patients were significantly more likely to be employed in the healthcare sector (14% vs. 9% in the general population; p = 0.005) and in the public sector (34% vs. 22% in the general population; p < 0.0001).\nCONCLUSION: Our results showed that relative to the general population, patients with paediatric-onset inflammatory bowel diseases have a higher educational level and a higher employment rate, and are more likely to work in the healthcare and public sectors."

        "abstract": "The intricate relationship between dietary habits and cognitive function is gaining increasing attention, with a focus on the gut-brain axis as a modifiable target for intervention. This review synthesizes evidence on the impact of dietary patterns, particularly the Mediterranean diet, plant-based diets, and low-carbohydrate diets, on cognitive health. These diets, rich in antioxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds, and neuroprotective nutrients, are suggested to slow cognitive decline and reduce the risk of neurodegenerative disorders through mechanisms such as reduced inflammation and oxidative stress, and enhanced neurogenesis. The Mediterranean diet has been associated with improved cognitive performance and a delay in cognitive decline in elderly populations. However, challenges in dietary intervention implementation, including adherence and individual variability, remain. Future research must adopt a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating long-term, large-scale, multicenter randomized controlled trials to assess the enduring impacts of various dietary patterns on cognitive function, considering socioeconomic and cultural factors. This review underscores the potential of dietary interventions to prevent and mitigate cognitive impairment, ultimately aiming to improve quality of life."

        "abstract": "Changes in population demographics indicate that the elderly population will reach 2.1 billion worldwide by 2050. In parallel, there will be an increase in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This review explores dysbiosis occurring in these pathologies and how virulence factors contribute to the worsening or development of clinical conditions, and it summarizes existing and potential ways to combat microorganisms related to these diseases. Microbiota imbalances can contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases by increasing intestinal permeability, exchanging information through innervation, and even acting as a Trojan horse affecting immune cells. The microorganisms of the microbiota produce virulence factors to protect themselves from host defenses, many of which contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. These virulence factors are expressed according to the genetic composition of each microorganism, leading to a wide range of factors to be considered. Among the main virulence factors are LPS, urease, curli proteins, amyloidogenic proteins, VacA, and CagA. These factors can also be packed into bacterial outer membrane vesicles, which transport proteins, RNA, and DNA, enabling distal communication that impacts various diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's."

        "abstract": "The gut microbiota, a complex community of microorganisms, plays a crucial role in gastrointestinal (GI) health, influencing digestion, metabolism, immune function, and the gut-brain axis. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in microbiota composition, is associated with GI disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and colorectal cancer (CRC). Conventional microbiota analysis methods, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), provide valuable insights but are often expensive, time-consuming, and destructive. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and highly sensitive alternative. This analytical technique relies on inelastic light scattering to generate molecular \"fingerprints\", enabling real-time, marker-free analysis of microbiota composition and metabolic activity. This review explores the principles, sample preparation techniques, and advancements in RS, including surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), for microbiota research. RS facilitates identifying microbial species, analysing key metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and monitoring microbiota responses to dietary and therapeutic interventions. The comparative analysis highlights RS's advantages over conventional techniques, such as the minimal sample preparation, real-time capabilities, and non-destructive nature. The integration of RS with machine learning enhances its diagnostic potential, enabling biomarker discovery and personalised treatment strategies for GI disorders. Challenges, including weak Raman signals and spectral complexity, are discussed alongside emerging solutions. As RS technology advances, mainly through portable spectrometers and AI integration, its clinical application in microbiota diagnostics and personalised medicine is poised to transform GI healthcare, bridging microbiota research with practical therapeutic strategies."

        "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences",
        "year": "2025",
        "abstract": "The gut-brain axis represents an important bidirectional communication network, with the vagus nerve acting as a central conduit for peripheral signals from the various gut organs to the central nervous system. Among the molecular mediators involved, serotonin (5-HT), synthesized predominantly by enterochromaffin cells in the gut, plays a pivotal role. Gut-derived serotonin activates vagal afferent fibers, transmitting signals to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and modulating serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) as well as the norepinephrinergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC). This interaction influences emotional regulation, stress responses, and immune modulation. Emerging evidence also highlights the role of microbial metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in enhancing serotonin synthesis and vagal activity, thereby shaping gut-brain communication. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on serotonin signaling, vagal nerve pathways, and central autonomic regulation, with an emphasis on their implications for neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders. By elucidating these pathways, novel therapeutic strategies targeting the gut-brain axis may be developed to improve mental and physical health outcomes."
